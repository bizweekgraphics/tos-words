  <p class="tiny">TERMS AND CONDITIONS  A. ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE, AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS OF SALE B. ITUNES STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS C. MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THE LEGAL AGREEMENTS SET OUT BELOW GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE, AND IBOOKS STORE SERVICES ("SERVICES"). TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS, CLICK "AGREE." IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT CLICK "AGREE," AND DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.  A. ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE, AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS OF SALE  PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUND POLICY  You agree that you will pay for all products you purchase through the Services, and that Apple may charge your payment method for any products purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING APPLE WITH A VALID PAYMENT METHOD FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. For details of how purchases are billed please visit support.apple.com/kb/HT5582.  Your total price will include the price of the product plus any applicable sales tax; such sales tax is based on the bill-to address and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you download the product. We will charge tax only in states where digital goods are taxable.  All sales and rentals of products are final.  Prices for products offered via the Services may change at any time, and the Services do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering.  If a product becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is a refund. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple.  1-Click®  1-Click is a registered service mark of Amazon.com, Inc., used under license. 1-Click is a convenient feature that allows you to make a purchase from the Services with a single click of your mouse or other input device. When accessing the Services on your computer, 1-Click purchasing may be activated via the dialog that appears when you click a Buy button. (You may reset this selection at any time by clicking Reset Warnings in your Account information). When accessing the Services on your Apple-branded products running iOS such as an iPad, iPod touch, or iPhone (“iOS Device”), 1-Click is activated for each transaction by tapping the button showing the price of the product, which reveals the Buy button. When 1-Click is activated, clicking or tapping the Buy button starts the download immediately and completes your transaction without any further steps.  GIFT CERTIFICATES, ITUNES CARDS, ALLOWANCES, AND CONTENT CODES  Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards, and Allowances are issued and managed by Apple Value Services, LLC (“Issuer”).  Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards, Content Codes, and Allowances, in addition to unused balances, are not redeemable for cash and cannot be returned for a cash refund (except as required by law); exchanged; resold; used to purchase Gifts, Gift Certificates, or iTunes Cards; used to provide Allowances; used for purchases on the Apple Online Store; or used in Apple Retail Stores. Unused balances are not transferable.  Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards, Content Codes, and Allowances purchased in the United States may be redeemed through the Services only in the United States, its territories, and possessions.  The Gift Certificate/iTunes Card cash value is 1/10 of one cent.  Neither Issuer nor Apple is responsible for lost or stolen Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards, Content Codes, or Allowances. Risk of loss and title for Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards, and Allowances transmitted electronically pass to the purchaser in Virginia upon electronic transmission to the recipient. Risk of loss and title for Content Codes transmitted electronically pass in California upon electronic transmission from Apple; for avoidance of doubt, such recipient may not always be you.  Apple reserves the right to close accounts and request alternative forms of payment if a Gift Certificate, iTunes Card, Content Code, or Allowance is fraudulently obtained or used on the Service.  APPLE, ISSUER, AND THEIR LICENSEES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CERTIFICATES, ITUNES CARDS, CONTENT CODES, ALLOWANCES, OR THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, MAC APP STORE, OR IBOOKS STORE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN THE EVENT THAT A GIFT CERTIFICATE, ITUNES CARD, CONTENT CODE, OR ALLOWANCE IS NONFUNCTIONAL, YOUR SOLE REMEDY, AND OUR SOLE LIABILITY, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH GIFT CERTIFICATE, ITUNES CARD, CONTENT CODE, OR ALLOWANCE. THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.  GIFTS  Gifts purchased from the Services may be purchased only for, and redeemed only by, persons in the United States, its territories, and possessions. Gift recipients must have compatible hardware and parental control settings to utilize some gifts.  PRE-ORDERS  By pre-ordering products, you are authorizing the Services to automatically charge your account and download the product when it becomes available. You may cancel your pre-order prior to the time the item becomes available.  ELECTRONIC CONTRACTING  Your use of the Services includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make transactions electronically. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY AND TO PAY FOR SUCH AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THIS SITE, INCLUDING NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS. In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.  Apple is not responsible for typographic errors.  B. ITUNES STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS  THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE INC. ("APPLE") GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE (THE “ITUNES SERVICE”).  THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE  Apple is the provider of the iTunes Service, which permits you to purchase or rent digital content ("iTunes Products") for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.  REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE ITUNES SERVICE  This iTunes Service is only available for individuals aged 13 years or older, unless you are under 13 years old and your Apple ID was provided to you as a result of a request by an approved educational institution. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it.  The iTunes Service is available to you only in the United States, its territories, and possessions. You agree not to use or attempt to use the iTunes Service from outside these locations. Apple may use technologies to verify your compliance.  Use of the iTunes Service requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended for regular use and is required for video. The latest version of required software is recommended to access the iTunes Service and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download iTunes Products previously purchased from the iTunes Service. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility. The iTunes Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the iTunes Service.  YOUR ACCOUNT  As a registered user of the iTunes Service, you may establish an account ("Account"). Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify Apple of any security breach of your Account. Apple shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account.  In order to purchase and download iTunes Products from the iTunes Service, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for purchases. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes on your computer or iOS Device; you can choose to allow your computer or Apple TV to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download iTunes Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make iTunes Product purchases or change settings to require a password for every transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer, iOS Device, or Apple TV. For more information, please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1904 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.  You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register with, and as you use, the iTunes Service ("iTunes Registration Data"), and you agree to update your iTunes Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete. You agree that Apple may store and use the iTunes Registration Data you provide for use in maintaining and billing fees to your Account.  AUTOMATIC DELIVERY AND DOWNLOADING PREVIOUS PURCHASES  When you first acquire music iTunes Products and music video iTunes Products (collectively, “iTunes Auto-Delivery Content”), you may elect to automatically receive (“auto-download”) copies of such iTunes Auto-Delivery Content on additional compatible iOS Devices and iTunes-authorized computers with compatible software by associating such iOS Devices and computers subject to the association rules below (each, an “Associated Device”). For each Associated Device, you may specify which type of iTunes Auto-Delivery Content, if any, may be auto-downloaded to it. On an Associated Device that is capable of receiving push notifications (“Push-Enabled”), including iOS Devices, the iTunes Auto-Delivery Content will auto-download to that Associated Device when it has an Internet connection; on an Associated Device that is not Push-Enabled, iTunes Auto-Delivery Content will automatically appear in the download queue and you may manually initiate the download within iTunes.  As an accommodation to you, subsequent to acquiring iTunes Auto-Delivery Content, purchased (i.e. not rented) movies iTunes Products and TV show iTunes Products (each, “iTunes Eligible Content”), you may download certain of such previously-purchased iTunes Eligible Content onto any Associated Device. Some iTunes Eligible Content that you previously purchased may not be available for subsequent download at any given time, and Apple shall have no liability to you in such event. As you may not be able to subsequently download certain previously-purchased iTunes Eligible Content, once you download an item of iTunes Eligible Content, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and you may want to back it up.  Association of Associated Devices is subject to the following terms:  (i) You may auto-download iTunes Auto-Delivery Content or download previously-purchased iTunes Eligible Content from an Account on up to 10 Associated Devices, provided no more than 5 are iTunes-authorized computers.  (ii) An Associated Device can be associated with only one Account at any given time.  (iii) You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only once every 90 days.  (iv) You may download previously-purchased free content onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free on the iTunes Service, but on no more than 5 iTunes-authorized computers.  An Apple TV is not an “Associated Device.” However, TV show iTunes Products and purchased (i.e. not rented) movies iTunes Products may be played back on compatible Apple TVs, provided that you may only play back any such TV show or movie on a limited number of Apple TVs at the same time.  Some pieces of iTunes Eligible Content may be large, and significant data charges may result from delivery of such iTunes Eligible Content over a data connection.  ITUNES MATCH  iTunes Match permits you to remotely access your matched or uploaded songs, and music videos you have purchased with your Account, along with related metadata, playlists, and other information about your iTunes Library (“iTunes Match Content”).  You may subscribe to iTunes Match for an annual fee. You must have a valid credit card on file with iTunes to subscribe. The subscription is non-refundable (except as required by applicable law), and will automatically renew for one-year periods until you cancel. Your account will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the expiration of the current subscription period. You may cancel automatic renewal by adjusting the iTunes Store account settings on your computer. You will no longer be able to access your iTunes Match Content from iTunes Match after the end of your subscription period.  iTunes Match works with libraries that contain up to 25,000 songs which are either (i) not currently available on the iTunes Service, or (ii) not purchased from the iTunes Service with your Account. Songs that do not meet certain quality criteria or that are not authorized for your computer are not eligible for iTunes Match.  iTunes Match will automatically scan the song files and collect other information that may be used to identify media in your iTunes library, such as the names of songs, song artists or song durations. iTunes Match will use this information to match songs to those currently available on the iTunes Store, and will make matched songs available to you in a format then available on the iTunes Store. If the song is not successfully matched, your copy of the song will be uploaded to Apple in the same format or a format determined by Apple. Apple reserves the right to limit types of content uploaded (for example, excessively large files). Matched or uploaded songs and related metadata will be available for access from an Associated Device that has been enabled for iTunes Match. Association of Associated Devices for iTunes Match is subject to the same terms as Automatic Delivery and Downloading Previous Purchases, and uploaded or matched songs and related information are deemed to be “iTunes Eligible Content.” You may also access iTunes Match Content from compatible Apple TVs, provided that you may only do so on a limited number of Apple TVs at the same time.  When you use iTunes Match, Genius will begin associating information about the media in your iTunes library with your Account; the association with your Account will continue for a period of time after your subscription ends. Apple will otherwise use this information as described in the Privacy Section of this Agreement. You will not be able to disable Genius while using iTunes Match, so if you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not use iTunes Match.  You hereby agree to use iTunes Match only for lawfully acquired content. Any use for illegitimate content infringes the rights of others and may subject you to civil and criminal penalties, including possible monetary damages, for copyright infringement.  iTunes Match is provided on an “AS IS” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information, including music, playlist, and play history, from your computer or device and from peripherals (including, without limitation, servers and other computers) connected thereto. You should back up all data and information on your computer or device and any peripherals prior to using iTunes Match. You expressly acknowledge and agree that all use of iTunes Match is at your sole risk. To the extent permitted by law, Apple shall have no liability with respect to your use of iTunes Match, including the inability to access matched or uploaded content.  PRIVACY  The iTunes Service is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy at http://www.apple.com/privacy/.  When you opt in to the Genius feature, Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information that can be used to identify media in your iTunes library on this computer, such as your play history and playlists. This includes media purchased through iTunes and media obtained from other sources. This information will be stored anonymously and will not be associated with your name or Account. When you use the Genius feature, Apple will use this information and the contents of your iTunes library, as well as other information, to give personalized recommendations to you.  Apple may only use this information and combine it with aggregated information from the iTunes libraries of other users who also opt in to this feature, your iTunes Store purchase history data, aggregated purchase history data from other iTunes Store users, and other information obtained from third parties, to:  • Create personalized playlists for you from your iTunes library.  • Provide you with recommendations regarding media and other products and services that you may wish to purchase.  • Provide recommendations regarding products and services to other users.  At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy.  Once you opt in to the Genius feature in iTunes, you will be able to create Genius playlists on Genius-capable devices. To enable the Genius feature on a device, you must sync it with your iTunes library after you have opted in.  If you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not enable the Genius feature. You can revoke your opt-in choice at any time by turning off the Genius feature from the Store menu in iTunes on your computer. After you opt out, iTunes will no longer send information about your iTunes library to Apple. If you have elected to share your library from multiple computers, you need to turn off the Genius feature from each computer. The Genius feature cannot be enabled or disabled from your device.  By opting in to the Genius feature, you consent to the use of your information as described above and as described in Apple’s Privacy Policy.  CONTENT AVAILABILITY  Apple reserves the right to change content options (including eligibility for particular features) without notice. For further information or concerns about closed captioning in specific content within the iTunes Store, please emailaccessibility@apple.com. You may also contact Thomas Montgomery, Accessibility Response Engineer, 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California 95014, Phone/Fax: 408-783-5512.  USE OF PURCHASED OR RENTED CONTENT  You agree that the iTunes Service and certain iTunes Products include security technology that limits your use of iTunes Products and that, whether or not iTunes Products are limited by security technology, you shall use iTunes Products in compliance with the applicable usage rules established by Apple and its licensors (“Usage Rules”), and that any other use of the iTunes Products may constitute a copyright infringement. Any security technology is an inseparable part of the iTunes Products. Apple reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules at any time. You agree not to violate, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security technology related to such Usage Rules for any reason—or to attempt or assist another person to do so. Usage Rules may be controlled and monitored by Apple for compliance purposes, and Apple reserves the right to enforce the Usage Rules without notice to you. You agree not to access the iTunes Service by any means other than through software that is provided by Apple for accessing the iTunes Service. You shall not access or attempt to access an Account that you are not authorized to access. You agree not to modify the software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the software, for any purposes including obtaining unauthorized access to the iTunes Service. Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.  USAGE RULES  (i) You shall be authorized to use iTunes Products only for personal, noncommercial use.  (ii) You shall be authorized to use iTunes Products on five iTunes-authorized devices at any time, except for Content Rentals (see below).  (iii) You shall be able to store iTunes Products from up to five different Accounts at a time on compatible devices, provided that each iPhone may sync tone iTunes Products with only a single iTunes-authorized device at a time, and syncing an iPhone with a different iTunes-authorized device will cause tone iTunes Products stored on that iPhone to be erased.  (iv) You shall be authorized to burn an audio playlist up to seven times.  (v) You shall not be entitled to burn video iTunes Products or tone iTunes Products.  (vi) iTunes Plus Products do not contain security technology that limits your usage of such products, and Usage Rules (ii) – (v) do not apply to iTunes Plus Products. You may copy, store, and burn iTunes Plus Products as reasonably necessary for personal, noncommercial use.  (vii) You shall be able to manually sync a movie from at least one iTunes-authorized device to devices that have manual sync mode, provided that the movie is associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorized device, where the primary iTunes-authorized device is the one that was first synced with the device or the one that you subsequently designate as primary using iTunes.  (viii) An HDCP connection is required to view content transmitted over HDMI.  (ix) Content Rentals  (a) Content rentals are viewable on only one device at a time. You must be connected to the iTunes Service when moving rentals, and you may do so only between your computer and other compatible devices. Content rented using your Apple TV, iPad, iPhone 4, or iPod touch (4th generation) may not be moved. If you move a rental to a compatible device and then use the iTunes Service to restore that device, or choose Settings > Reset > Erase all content and settings on that device, the rental will be permanently deleted.  (b) Once you purchase a rental, you must fully download the rental within thirty (30) days. You have thirty (30) days after downloading a rental to begin viewing. Once you begin viewing, you have twenty-four (24) hours to finish viewing a movie. Stopping, pausing, or restarting a rental does not extend the available time for viewing.  Some iTunes Products, including but not limited to Content rentals, may be downloaded only once and cannot be replaced if lost for any reason. It is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage iTunes Products once downloaded, and you may wish to back them up.  The delivery of iTunes Products does not transfer to you any commercial or promotional use rights in the iTunes Products. Any burning or exporting capabilities are solely an accommodation to you and shall not constitute a grant, waiver, or other limitation of any rights of the copyright owners in any content embodied in any iTunes Product.  You acknowledge that, because some aspects of the iTunes Service, iTunes Products, and administration of the Usage Rules entails the ongoing involvement of Apple, if Apple changes any part of or discontinues the iTunes Service, which Apple may do at its election, you may not be able to use iTunes Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and that Apple shall have no liability to you in such case.  SEASON PASS, MULTI-PASS, ITUNES PASS  The full price of the Season Pass, Multi-Pass, or iTunes Pass is charged upon purchase. You must connect to the iTunes Service and download any remaining Pass content within 90 days after the final Pass content becomes available (or such other time period as may be specified on the purchase page), after which that content may no longer be available for download as part of the purchase. If automatic renewal is selected when you purchase a Multi-Pass, you will be charged the full price of each subsequent Multi-Pass cycle, unless and until you cancel automatic renewal prior to the beginning of the subsequent Multi-Pass cycle (in the Manage Passes section of your Account information). If a network or studio delivers fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Account the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes.  HIGH-DEFINITION (HD) ITUNES PRODUCTS  HD iTunes Products are viewable only on HD capable devices; however, HD iTunes Products purchased (not rented) include a standard-definition version for use on non-HD devices.  SUBMISSIONS TO THE ITUNES SERVICE  The iTunes Service may offer interactive features that allow you to submit materials (including links to third-party content) on areas of the iTunes Service accessible and viewable by the public. You agree that any use by you of such features, including any materials submitted by you, shall be your sole responsibility, shall not infringe or violate the rights of any other party or violate any laws, contribute to or encourage infringing or otherwise unlawful conduct, or otherwise be obscene, objectionable, or in poor taste.

C. MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS  THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE INC. ("APPLE") GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE SERVICES (THE “APP AND BOOK SERVICES”).  THE MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE SERVICES  Apple is the provider of the App and Book Services that permit you to license software products and digital content (the “App and Book Products”) for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. For App Store Products (defined below), end users may be individuals acting in their own capacities, commercial enterprises or educational institutions.  REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES  These App and Book Services are only available for individuals aged 13 years or older, unless you are under 13 years old and your Apple ID was provided to you as a result of a request by an approved educational institution. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it.  The App and Book Services are available to you only in the United States, its territories, and possessions. You agree not to use or attempt to use the App and Book Services from outside these locations. Apple may use technologies to verify your compliance.  Use of the App and Book Services requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended. The latest version of required software (including, but not limited to iTunes and/or Mac App Store software) is recommended to access the App and Book Services and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download App and Book Products previously purchased from the App and Book Services. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility. The App and Book Services are not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the App and Book Services.  YOUR ACCOUNT  As a registered user of the App and Book Services, you may establish an account ("Account"). Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account, and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify Apple of any security breach of your Account. Apple shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account.  In order to purchase and download App and Book Products from the App and Book Services, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for purchases. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes; you can choose to allow your computer to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download App and Book Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make App and Book Product purchases or change settings to require a password for every App and Book Product transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer or iOS Device. For more information, please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1904 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.  You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register with, and as you use, the App and Book Services ("App and Book Registration Data"), and you agree to update your App and Book Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete. You agree that Apple may store and use the App and Book Registration Data you provide for use in maintaining and billing fees to your Account.  AUTOMATIC DELIVERY AND DOWNLOADING PREVIOUS PURCHASES  When you first acquire App Store Products, as defined below, (excluding products acquired from the Mac App Store) or iBooks Store Products, as defined below, through the App and Book Services (collectively, “Eligible Content”), you may elect to automatically receive (“auto-download”) copies of such Eligible Content on additional compatible iOS Devices and iTunes-authorized computers with compatible software by associating such iOS Devices and computers subject to the association rules below (each, an “Associated Device”). For each Associated Device, you may specify which type of Eligible Content, if any, may be auto-downloaded to it. On an Associated Device that is capable of receiving push notifications (“Push-Enabled”), including iOS Devices, the Eligible Content will auto-download to that Associated Device when it has an Internet connection; on an Associated Device that is not Push-Enabled, including those running on the Windows operating system, Eligible Content will automatically appear in the download queue and you may manually initiate the download within iTunes.  As an accommodation to you, subsequent to acquiring Eligible Content, you may download certain of such previously-purchased Eligible Content onto any Associated Device. Some Eligible Content that you previously purchased may not be available for subsequent download at any given time, and Apple shall have no liability to you in such event. As you may not be able to subsequently download certain previously-purchased Eligible Content, once you download an item of Eligible Content, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and you may want to back it up.  Association of Associated Devices is subject to the following terms:  (i) You may auto-download Eligible Content or download previously-purchased Eligible Content from an Account on up to 10 Associated Devices, provided no more than 5 are iTunes-authorized computers.  (ii) An Associated Device can be associated with only one Account at any given time.  (iii) You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only once every 90 days.  (iv) You may download previously-purchased free content onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free on the App and Book Services, but on no more than 5 iTunes-authorized computers.  The above terms (i) to (iv) do not apply to App Store Products.  Some pieces of Eligible Content may be large, and significant data charges may result from delivery of such Eligible Content over a data connection.  AUTOMATIC DELIVERY OF UPDATES  Your device or computer will periodically check with the App Store and Mac App Store for updates to the apps on your device or computer and, if available, the update may automatically download and install. You agree that Apple, through the App Store and Mac App Store, may automatically download and install updates onto your device(s) or computer. You can turn off automatic updates altogether at any time by changing the automatic updates settings on your device or computer.  PRIVACY  The App and Book Services are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy at http://www.apple.com/privacy/.  USE OF APP AND BOOK PRODUCTS AND THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES  You agree that the App and Book Services and certain App and Book Products include security technology that limits your use of App and Book Products and that, whether or not App and Book Products are limited by security technology, you shall use App and Book Products in compliance with the applicable usage rules established by Apple and its principals (“Usage Rules”), and that any other use of the App and Book Products may constitute a copyright infringement. Any security technology is an inseparable part of the App and Book Products. Apple reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules at any time. You agree not to violate, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security technology related to such Usage Rules for any reason—or to attempt or assist another person to do so. Usage Rules may be controlled and monitored by Apple for compliance purposes, and Apple reserves the right to enforce the Usage Rules without notice to you. You agree not to access the App and Book Services by any means other than through software that is provided by Apple for accessing the App and Book Services. You shall not access or attempt to access an Account that you are not authorized to access. You agree not to modify the software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the software, for any purposes including obtaining unauthorized access to the App and Book Services. Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.  The delivery of App and Book Products does not transfer to you any promotional use rights in the App and Book Products.  You acknowledge that, because some aspects of the App and Book Services, App and Book Products, and administration of the Usage Rules entails the ongoing involvement of Apple, if Apple changes any part of or discontinues the App and Book Services, which Apple may do at its election, you may not be able to use App and Book Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and that Apple shall have no liability to you in such case.  SUBMISSIONS TO THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES  The App and Book Services may offer interactive features that allow you to submit materials (including links to third-party content) on areas of the App and Book Services accessible and viewable by other users of the App and Book Services and the public. You agree that any use by you of such features, including any materials submitted by you, shall be your sole responsibility, shall not infringe or violate the rights of any other party or violate any laws, contribute to or encourage infringing or otherwise unlawful conduct, or otherwise be obscene, objectionable, or in poor taste. You also agree that you have obtained all necessary rights and licenses. You agree to provide accurate and complete information in connection with your submission of any materials on the App and Book Services. You hereby grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive license to use such materials as part of the App and Book Services, and in relation to App and Book Products, without any compensation or obligation to you. Apple reserves the right to not post or publish any materials, and to remove or edit any material, at any time in its sole discretion without notice or liability. You may not submit reviews or ratings for App Store Products downloaded using a promotional Content Code.  Apple has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any materials submitted by you or otherwise available on the App and Book Services, to investigate any reported or apparent violation of this Agreement, and to take any action that Apple in its sole discretion deems appropriate, including, without limitation, termination hereunder or under Apple’s Copyright Policy (http://www.apple.com/legal/copyright.html).  THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS  Certain content, App and Book Products, and services available via the App and Book Services may include materials from third parties. Apple may provide links to third-party websites as a convenience to you. You agree that Apple is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy and Apple does not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. You agree that you will not use any third-party materials in a manner that would infringe or violate the rights of any other party and that Apple is not in any way responsible for any such use by you.  OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL  You understand that by using the App and Book Services, you may encounter material that you may deem to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and that such content may or may not be identified as having explicit material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the App and Book Services at your sole risk and Apple shall have no liability to you for material that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. App and Book Product types and descriptions are provided for convenience, and you agree that Apple does not guarantee their accuracy.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  You agree that the App and Book Services, including but not limited to App and Book Products, graphics, user interface, audio clips, editorial content, and the scripts and software used to implement the App and Book Services, contain proprietary information and material that is owned by Apple and/or its principals, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Apple and its principals reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any App and Book Products, content, or other materials comprising a part of the App and Book Services at any time without notice. In no event will Apple be liable for making these changes. Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain features or portions of the App and Book Services, in any case and without notice or liability.  All copyrights in and to the App and Book Services (including the compilation of content, postings, links to other Internet resources, and descriptions of those resources) and related software are owned by Apple and/or its principals, who reserve all their rights in law and equity. THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR ANY PART OF THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES, EXCEPT FOR USE OF THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES AS PERMITTED IN THIS AGREEMENT, IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND INFRINGES ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND MAY SUBJECT YOU TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES, INCLUDING POSSIBLE MONETARY DAMAGES, FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.  Apple, the Apple logo, iTunes, App Store, and other Apple trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the App and Book Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of Apple Inc. in the U.S. and/or other countries.

IN NO CASE SHALL APPLE, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, PRINCIPALS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES OR FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT (OR PRODUCT) POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY.

You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, certain App and Book Products, third-party content, or third-party software.

You agree to comply with all local, state, federal, and national laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations that apply to your use of the App and Book Services. All transactions on the App and Book Services are governed by California law, without giving effect to its conflict of law provisions. Your use of the App and Book Services may also be subject to other laws.

ADDITIONAL MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS  LICENSE OF MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE PRODUCTS  The software products made available through the Mac App Store and App Store (collectively, the “App Store Products”) are licensed, not sold, to you. There are two (2) categories of App Store Products, as follows: (i) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by Apple ( “Apple Products”); and (ii) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by a third-party developer ( “Third-Party Products”). The category of a particular App Store Product (Apple Product or Third-Party Product) is identified on the Mac App Store application or App Store application.  Your license to each App Store Product is subject to the Licensed Application End User License Agreement set forth below, and you agree that such terms will apply unless the App Store Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement entered into between you and the licensor of that App Store Product (the “Application Provider”), in which case the Application Provider’s end user license agreement will apply to that App Store Product. The Application Provider reserves all rights in and to the App Store Product not expressly granted to you.  You acknowledge that the license to each Apple Product that you obtain through the App Store Services, as defined below, is a binding agreement between you and Apple. You acknowledge that: you are acquiring the license to each Third-Party Product from the Application Provider; Apple is acting as agent for the Application Provider in providing each such Third-Party Product to you; and Apple is not a party to the license between you and the Application Provider with respect to that Third-Party Product. The Application Provider of each Third-Party Product is solely responsible for that Third-Party Product, the content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Third-Party Product.  You acknowledge and agree that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement or the Application Provider’s end user license agreement, as the case may be, for each Third-Party Product. You also agree that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license to any such Third-Party Product, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such license against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.  IN-APP PURCHASES  Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to receive additional services, or licenses to additional functionality or content for use within the App Store Product ("In App Purchases"). In App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App Store Product (for example, virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can be downloaded only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a consumable In App Purchase is acquired and received by you, Apple shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage. All In App Purchases are deemed App Store Products, and In App Purchases received within Third-Party Products are deemed Third-Party Products, and treated as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions.  You must authenticate to acquire In-App Purchases separately from any authentication to obtain App Store Products by entering your password when prompted, but once you have authenticated to obtain an In-App Purchase, you will be able to acquire additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to acquire In-App Purchases on your iOS Device by following the steps outlined at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.  IN-APP SUBSCRIPTIONS  Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to acquire content on a subscription basis (“In App Subscriptions”). Paid In App Subscriptions are non-refundable. In App Subscriptions will automatically renew for the applicable time period you have selected, and, where applicable, your Account will be charged no more than 24-hours prior to the expiration of the current In App Subscription. You may cancel automatic renewal of paid In App Subscriptions by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Account and selecting the subscription you want to modify. The auto-renew feature of the subscription will be turned off if the Application Provider increases the price of the subscription. You may cancel free In App Subscriptions by deleting the App Store Product from your device. Certain paid In App Subscriptions may offer a free trial period prior to charging your Account. If you decide you do not want to purchase the In App Subscription, turn off auto-renewal in your Account settings during the free trial period. Certain In App Subscriptions may be designated as “Newsstand” products, in which case they will appear only within the Newsstand application on your device after download. You should also review additional information about the paid In App Subscription offer at the point of sale within the App Store Product. We may ask for your permission to provide the name, email address and zip code listed in your Account to the Application Provider so that the Application Provider can send you marketing messages about its own products in accordance with its publicly posted privacy policy. Once the Application Provider has this information, it will be treated in accordance with the Application Provider’s privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of the Application Provider before agreeing to give it your personal information. For more information, please review the Application Provider’s privacy policy or contact the Application Provider directly.  GENIUS FOR APPS AND POPULAR NEAR ME  When you opt in to the Genius for Apps feature or use Popular Near Me via enabling Location Services, Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information related to certain of your App Store Products, such as your time spent with each App Store Product and the number of times each App Store Product is launched. This information is stored anonymously and will not be associated with your name or Account. When you use the Genius for Apps feature, Apple will use this information, as well as other information, such as your App Store Product download history, to give personalized recommendations to you.  Apple may use this information and combine it with aggregated information from other users who opt in to this feature, your iTunes Store purchase history data, your App Store download data, aggregated App Store Product download data from other users, and other information like customer ratings of App Store Products, to:  • Provide you with recommendations regarding App Store Products, media, and other products and services that you may wish to purchase, download, or use.  • Provide recommendations to other users.  At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy.  Once you opt in to the Genius for Apps feature on a Genius-capable system, you will be able to create Genius recommendations on that system.  If you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your device or system in this manner, you should not enable the Genius feature. You can opt out at any time by turning off the Genius feature from the App Store Account page on your device and/or system. If you have elected to share Genius for Apps information from multiple devices and/or systems, you need to turn off the Genius feature from each device and system to opt out.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  To avoid muscle, joint, or eye strain during video game play, you should always take frequent breaks from playing, and take a longer rest if you experience any soreness, fatigue, or discomfort. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns, including while playing video games or watching videos. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, altered vision, tingling, numbness, or other discomforts. Consult a doctor before playing video games if you have ever suffered these or similar symptoms, and stop playing immediately and see a doctor if they occur during game play. Parents should monitor their children’s video game play for signs of symptoms.

  <h1>Herman Melville, “Bartleby, the Scrivener”</h1>
  <p>14,474 words</p>
  <p class="tiny">BARTLEBY, THE SCRIVENER.  A STORY OF WALL-STREET.  I am a rather elderly man.  The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:--I mean the law-copyists or scriveners.  I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep.  But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of.  While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man.  It is an irreparable loss to literature.  Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small.  What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, _that_ is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.  Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention of myself, my _employees_, my business, my chambers, and general surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.  Imprimis:  I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best.  Hence, though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace.  I am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among rich men's bonds and mortgages and title-deeds.  All who know me, consider me an eminently _safe_ man.  The late John Jacob Astor, a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method.  I do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion.  I will freely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor's good opinion.  Some time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my avocations had been largely increased.  The good old office, now extinct in the State of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred upon me.  It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly remunerative.  I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in dangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted to be rash here and declare, that I consider the sudden and violent abrogation of the office of Master in Chancery, by the new Constitution, as a--premature act; inasmuch as I had counted upon a life-lease of the profits, whereas I only received those of a few short years.  But this is by the way.  My chambers were up stairs at No.--Wall-street.  At one end they looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft, penetrating the building from top to bottom.  This view might have been considered rather tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape painters call "life."  But if so, the view from the other end of my chambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing more.  In that direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick wall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no spy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all near-sighted spectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes.  Owing to the great height of the surrounding buildings, and my chambers being on the second floor, the interval between this wall and mine not a little resembled a huge square cistern.  At the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons as copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy. First, Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut.  These may seem names, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory.  In truth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my three clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or characters.  Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age, that is, somewhere not far from sixty.  In the morning, one might say, his face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o'clock, meridian--his dinner hour--it blazed like a grate full of Christmas coals; and continued blazing--but, as it were, with a gradual wane--till 6 o'clock, P.M. or thereabouts, after which I saw no more of the proprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with the sun, seemed to set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with the like regularity and undiminished glory.  There are many singular coincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among which was the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams from his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that critical moment, began the daily period when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four hours.  Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far from it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic.  There was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of activity about him.  He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand. All his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after twelve o'clock, meridian.  Indeed, not only would he be reckless and sadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went further, and was rather noisy.  At such times, too, his face flamed with augmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite.  He made an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in mending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them on the floor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table, boxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold in an elderly man like him.  Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most valuable person to me, and all the time before twelve o'clock, meridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easy to be matched--for these reasons, I was willing to overlook his eccentricities, though indeed, occasionally, I remonstrated with him.  I did this very gently, however, because, though the civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of men in the morning, yet in the afternoon he was disposed, upon provocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue, in fact, insolent.  Now, valuing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to lose them; yet, at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve o'clock; and being a man of peace, unwilling by my admonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him; I took upon me, one Saturday noon (he was always worse on Saturdays), to hint to him, very kindly, that perhaps now that he was growing old, it might be well to abridge his labors; in short, he need not come to my chambers after twelve o'clock, but, dinner over, had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself till teatime. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon devotions.  His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he oratorically assured me--gesticulating with a long ruler at the other end of the room--that if his services in the morning were useful, how indispensable, then, in the afternoon?  "With submission, sir," said Turkey on this occasion, "I consider myself your right-hand man.  In the morning I but marshal and deploy my columns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly charge the foe, thus!"--and he made a violent thrust with the ruler.  "But the blots, Turkey," intimated I.  "True,--but, with submission, sir, behold these hairs!  I am getting old.  Surely, sir, a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged against gray hairs.  Old age--even if it blot the page--is honorable.  With submission, sir, we _both_ are getting old."  This appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted.  At all events, I saw that go he would not.  So I made up my mind to let him stay, resolving, nevertheless, to see to it, that during the afternoon he had to do with my less important papers.  Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the whole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty.  I always deemed him the victim of two evil powers--ambition and indigestion.  The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal documents.  The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions, hissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked. Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get this table to suit him.  He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts, bits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper.  But no invention would answer.  If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a man using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:--then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms.  If now he lowered the table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there was a sore aching in his back.  In short, the truth of the matter was, Nippers knew not what he wanted.  Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to be rid of a scrivener's table altogether.  Among the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his clients.  Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times, considerable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little business at the Justices' courts, and was not unknown on the steps of the Tombs.  I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual who called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he insisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged title-deed, a bill.  But with all his failings, and the annoyances he caused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man to me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment.  Added to this, he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit upon my chambers.  Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me.  His clothes were apt to look oily and smell of eating-houses.  He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer.  His coats were execrable; his hat not to be handled.  But while the hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his natural civility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another matter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect.  The truth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time.  As Nippers once observed, Turkey's money went chiefly for red ink.  One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable looking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable warmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck.  I thought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons.  But no.  I verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses.  In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his oats, so Turkey felt his coat.  It made him insolent.  He was a man whom prosperity harmed.  Though concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey I had my own private surmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that whatever might by his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a temperate young man.  But indeed, nature herself seemed to have been his vintner, and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that all subsequent potations were needless. When I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers, Nippers would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his table, spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a perverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly perceive that for Nippers, brandy and water were altogether superfluous.  It was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar cause--indigestion--the irritability and consequent nervousness of Nippers, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon he was comparatively mild.  So that Turkey's paroxysms only coming on about twelve o'clock, I never had to do with their eccentricities at one time.  Their fits relieved each other like guards.  When Nippers' was on, Turkey's was off; and _vice versa_.  This was a good natural arrangement under the circumstances.  Ginger Nut, the third on my list, was a lad some twelve years old.  His father was a carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of a cart, before he died.  So he sent him to my office as student at law, errand boy, and cleaner and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a week. He had a little desk to himself, but he did not use it much.  Upon inspection, the drawer exhibited a great array of the shells of various sorts of nuts.  Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole noble science of the law was contained in a nut-shell.  Not the least among the employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with the most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey and Nippers.  Copying law papers being proverbially dry, husky sort of business, my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths very often with Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the Custom House and Post Office.  Also, they sent Ginger Nut very frequently for that peculiar cake--small, flat, round, and very spicy--after which he had been named by them.  Of a cold morning when business was but dull, Turkey would gobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere wafers--indeed they sell them at the rate of six or eight for a penny--the scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of the crisp particles in his mouth.  Of all the fiery afternoon blunders and flurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once moistening a ginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a seal.  I came within an ace of dismissing him then.  But he mollified me by making an oriental bow, and saying--"With submission, sir, it was generous of me to find you in stationery on my own account."  Now my original business--that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and drawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts--was considerably increased by receiving the master's office.  There was now great work for scriveners.  Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I must have additional help.  In answer to my advertisement, a motionless young man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being open, for it was summer.  I can see that figure now--pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn!  It was Bartleby.  After a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to have among my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect, which I thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey, and the fiery one of Nippers.  I should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my premises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the other by myself.  According to my humor I threw open these doors, or closed them.  I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the folding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done.  I placed his desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy back-yards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections, commanded at present no view at all, though it gave some light.  Within three feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far above, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a dome.  Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high green folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my sight, though not remove him from my voice.  And thus, in a manner, privacy and society were conjoined.  At first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing.  As if long famishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents.  There was no pause for digestion.  He ran a day and night line, copying by sun-light and by candle-light.  I should have been quite delighted with his application, had he been cheerfully industrious.  But he wrote on silently, palely, mechanically.  It is, of course, an indispensable part of a scrivener's business to verify the accuracy of his copy, word by word.  Where there are two or more scriveners in an office, they assist each other in this examination, one reading from the copy, the other holding the original. It is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair.  I can readily imagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether intolerable.  For example, I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet Byron would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby to examine a law document of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a crimpy hand.  Now and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist in comparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for this purpose.  One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me behind the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such trivial occasions.  It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I abruptly called to Bartleby.  In my haste and natural expectancy of instant compliance, I sat with my head bent over the original on my desk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat nervously extended with the copy, so that immediately upon emerging from his retreat, Bartleby might snatch it and proceed to business without the least delay.  In this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating what it was I wanted him to do--namely, to examine a small paper with me.  Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his privacy, Bartleby in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, "I would prefer not to."  I sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties. Immediately it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Bartleby had entirely misunderstood my meaning.  I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could assume.  But in quite as clear a one came the previous reply, "I would prefer not to."  "Prefer not to," echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the room with a stride.  "What do you mean?  Are you moon-struck?  I want you to help me compare this sheet here--take it," and I thrust it towards him.  "I would prefer not to," said he.  I looked at him steadfastly.  His face was leanly composed; his gray eye dimly calm.  Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him.  Had there been the least uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in other words, had there been any thing ordinarily human about him, doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises.  But as it was, I should have as soon thought of turning my pale plaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors.  I stood gazing at him awhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then reseated myself at my desk.  This is very strange, thought I.  What had one best do?  But my business hurried me.  I concluded to forget the matter for the present, reserving it for my future leisure.  So calling Nippers from the other room, the paper was speedily examined.  A few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being quadruplicates of a week's testimony taken before me in my High Court of Chancery.  It became necessary to examine them.  It was an important suit, and great accuracy was imperative.  Having all things arranged I called Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to place the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should read from the original.  Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut had taken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when I called to Bartleby to join this interesting group.  "Bartleby!  quick, I am waiting."  I heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and soon he appeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.  "What is wanted?" said he mildly.  "The copies, the copies," said I hurriedly.  "We are going to examine them.  There"--and I held towards him the fourth quadruplicate.  "I would prefer not to," he said, and gently disappeared behind the screen.  For a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the head of my seated column of clerks.  Recovering myself, I advanced towards the screen, and demanded the reason for such extraordinary conduct.  "_Why_ do you refuse?"  "I would prefer not to."  With any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion, scorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence.  But there was something about Bartleby that not only strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me.  I began to reason with him.  "These are your own copies we are about to examine.  It is labor saving to you, because one examination will answer for your four papers.  It is common usage.  Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy.  Is it not so?  Will you not speak?  Answer!"  "I prefer not to," he replied in a flute-like tone.  It seemed to me that while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every statement that I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not gainsay the irresistible conclusions; but, at the same time, some paramount consideration prevailed with him to reply as he did.  "You are decided, then, not to comply with my request--a request made according to common usage and common sense?"  He briefly gave me to understand that on that point my judgment was sound.  Yes:  his decision was irreversible.  It is not seldom the case that when a man is browbeaten in some unprecedented and violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in his own plainest faith.  He begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that, wonderful as it may be, all the justice and all the reason is on the other side.  Accordingly, if any disinterested persons are present, he turns to them for some reinforcement for his own faltering mind.  "Turkey," said I, "what do you think of this?  Am I not right?"  "With submission, sir," said Turkey, with his blandest tone, "I think that you are."  "Nippers," said I, "what do _you_ think of it?"  "I think I should kick him out of the office."  (The reader of nice perceptions will here perceive that, it being morning, Turkey's answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but Nippers replies in ill-tempered ones.  Or, to repeat a previous sentence, Nippers' ugly mood was on duty and Turkey's off.)  "Ginger Nut," said I, willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my behalf, "what do you think of it?"  "I think, sir, he's a little _luny_," replied Ginger Nut with a grin.  "You hear what they say," said I, turning towards the screen, "come forth and do your duty."  But he vouchsafed no reply.  I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But once more business hurried me.  I determined again to postpone the consideration of this dilemma to my future leisure.  With a little trouble we made out to examine the papers without Bartleby, though at every page or two, Turkey deferentially dropped his opinion that this proceeding was quite out of the common; while Nippers, twitching in his chair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out between his set teeth occasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the screen.  And for his (Nippers') part, this was the first and the last time he would do another man's business without pay.  Meanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but his own peculiar business there.  Some days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work.  His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I observed that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any where.  As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be outside of my office.  He was a perpetual sentry in the corner.  At about eleven o'clock though, in the morning, I noticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward the opening in Bartleby's screen, as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat.  The boy would then leave the office jingling a few pence, and reappear with a handful of ginger-nuts which he delivered in the hermitage, receiving two of the cakes for his trouble.  He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly speaking; he must be a vegetarian then; but no; he never eats even vegetables, he eats nothing but ginger-nuts.  My mind then ran on in reveries concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts.  Ginger-nuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the final flavoring one.  Now what was ginger?  A hot, spicy thing.  Was Bartleby hot and spicy?  Not at all.  Ginger, then, had no effect upon Bartleby. Probably he preferred it should have none.  Nothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance.  If the individual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting one perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of the former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves impossible to be solved by his judgment.  Even so, for the most part, I regarded Bartleby and his ways.  Poor fellow! thought I, he means no mischief; it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary.  He is useful to me.  I can get along with him.  If I turn him away, the chances are he will fall in with some less indulgent employer, and then he will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve. Yes.  Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval.  To befriend Bartleby; to humor him in his strange willfulness, will cost me little or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove a sweet morsel for my conscience.  But this mood was not invariable with me.  The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me.  I felt strangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some angry spark from him answerable to my own.  But indeed I might as well have essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap.  But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued:  "Bartleby," said I, "when those papers are all copied, I will compare them with you."  "I would prefer not to."  "How?  Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?"  No answer.  I threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and Nippers, exclaimed in an excited manner--  "He says, a second time, he won't examine his papers.  What do you think of it, Turkey?"  It was afternoon, be it remembered.  Turkey sat glowing like a brass boiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted papers.  "Think of it?" roared Turkey; "I think I'll just step behind his screen, and black his eyes for him!"  So saying, Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic position.  He was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I detained him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey's combativeness after dinner.  "Sit down, Turkey," said I, "and hear what Nippers has to say.  What do you think of it, Nippers?  Would I not be justified in immediately dismissing Bartleby?"  "Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir.  I think his conduct quite unusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself.  But it may only be a passing whim."  "Ah," exclaimed I, "you have strangely changed your mind then--you speak very gently of him now."  "All beer," cried Turkey; "gentleness is effects of beer--Nippers and I dined together to-day.  You see how gentle _I_ am, sir.  Shall I go and black his eyes?"  "You refer to Bartleby, I suppose.  No, not to-day, Turkey," I replied; "pray, put up your fists."  I closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby.  I felt additional incentives tempting me to my fate.  I burned to be rebelled against again.  I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.  "Bartleby," said I, "Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post Office, won't you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there is any thing for me."  "I would prefer not to."  "You _will_ not?"  "I _prefer_ not."  I staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study.  My blind inveteracy returned.  Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?--my hired clerk?  What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse to do?  "Bartleby!"  No answer.  "Bartleby," in a louder tone.  No answer.  "Bartleby," I roared.  Like a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.  "Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me."  "I prefer not to," he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared.  "Very good, Bartleby," said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe self-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible retribution very close at hand.  At the moment I half intended something of the kind.  But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my dinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the day, suffering much from perplexity and distress of mind.  Shall I acknowledge it?  The conclusion of this whole business was, that it soon became a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener, by the name of Bartleby, and a desk there; that he copied for me at the usual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words); but he was permanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers, one of compliment doubtless to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was never on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort; and that even if entreated to take upon him such a matter, it was generally understood that he would prefer not to--in other words, that he would refuse pointblank.  As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby.  His steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances, made him a valuable acquisition.  One prime thing was this,--_he was always there;_--first in the morning, continually through the day, and the last at night.  I had a singular confidence in his honesty.  I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands.  Sometimes to be sure I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him.  For it was exceeding difficult to bear in mind all the time those strange peculiarities, privileges, and unheard of exemptions, forming the tacit stipulations on Bartleby's part under which he remained in my office.  Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently summon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers.  Of course, from behind the screen the usual answer, "I prefer not to," was sure to come; and then, how could a human creature with the common infirmities of our nature, refrain from bitterly exclaiming upon such perverseness--such unreasonableness.  However, every added repulse of this sort which I received only tended to lessen the probability of my repeating the inadvertence.  Here it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen occupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there were several keys to my door.  One was kept by a woman residing in the attic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments.  Another was kept by Turkey for convenience sake.  The third I sometimes carried in my own pocket.  The fourth I knew not who had.  Now, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a celebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground, I thought I would walk around to my chambers for a while.  Luckily I had my key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by something inserted from the inside.  Quite surprised, I called out; when to my consternation a key was turned from within; and thrusting his lean visage at me, and holding the door ajar, the apparition of Bartleby appeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise in a strangely tattered dishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he was deeply engaged just then, and--preferred not admitting me at present.  In a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round the block two or three times, and by that time he would probably have concluded his affairs.  Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my law-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly _nonchalance_, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange effect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and did as desired.  But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion against the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener.  Indeed, it was his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but unmanned me, as it were.  For I consider that one, for the time, is a sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate to him, and order him away from his own premises.  Furthermore, I was full of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my office in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday morning.  Was any thing amiss going on?  Nay, that was out of the question.  It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby was an immoral person.  But what could he be doing there?--copying?  Nay again, whatever might be his eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently decorous person.  He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity.  Besides, it was Sunday; and there was something about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that he would by any secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.  Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity, at last I returned to the door.  Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened it, and entered.  Bartleby was not to be seen.  I looked round anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone.  Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed.  The cushioned seat of a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean, reclining form.  Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under the empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin, with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese.  Yes, thought I, it is evident enough that Bartleby has been making his home here, keeping bachelor's hall all by himself. Immediately then the thought came sweeping across me, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed!  His poverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible!  Think of it.  Of a Sunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day it is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with industry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole spectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous--a sort of innocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!  For the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging melancholy seized me.  Before, I had never experienced aught but a not-unpleasing sadness.  The bond of a common humanity now drew me irresistibly to gloom.  A fraternal melancholy!  For both I and Bartleby were sons of Adam.  I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I had seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi of Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought to myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay; but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none.  These sad fancyings--chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain--led on to other and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of Bartleby.  Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me.  The scrivener's pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet.  Suddenly I was attracted by Bartleby's closed desk, the key in open sight left in the lock.  I mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity, thought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will make bold to look within.  Every thing was methodically arranged, the papers smoothly placed.  The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the files of documents, I groped into their recesses.  Presently I felt something there, and dragged it out.  It was an old bandanna handkerchief, heavy and knotted.  I opened it, and saw it was a savings' bank.  I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man.  I remembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals he had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him reading--no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand looking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick wall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house; while his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like Turkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any where in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk, unless indeed that was the case at present; that he had declined telling who he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives in the world; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill health. And more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallid--how shall I call it?--of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an austere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame compliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the slightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from his long-continued motionlessness, that behind his screen he must be standing in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.  Revolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently discovered fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and home, and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these things, a prudential feeling began to steal over me.  My first emotions had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into repulsion.  So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not.  They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart.  It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill.  To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain.  And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul rid of it.  What I saw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of innate and incurable disorder.  I might give alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach.  I did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that morning.  Somehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time from church-going.  I walked homeward, thinking what I would do with Bartleby.  Finally, I resolved upon this;--I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning, touching his history, etc., and if he declined to answer them openly and unreservedly (and I supposed he would prefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I would be happy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place, wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses. Moreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want of aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply.  The next morning came.  "Bartleby," said I, gently calling to him behind his screen.  No reply.  "Bartleby," said I, in a still gentler tone, "come here; I am not going to ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to do--I simply wish to speak to you."  Upon this he noiselessly slid into view.  "Will you tell me, Bartleby, where you were born?"  "I would prefer not to."  "Will you tell me _any thing_ about yourself?"  "I would prefer not to."  "But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me?  I feel friendly towards you."  He did not look at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my bust of Cicero, which as I then sat, was directly behind me, some six inches above my head.  "What is your answer, Bartleby?" said I, after waiting a considerable time for a reply, during which his countenance remained immovable, only there was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white attenuated mouth.  "At present I prefer to give no answer," he said, and retired into his hermitage.  It was rather weak in me I confess, but his manner on this occasion nettled me.  Not only did there seem to lurk in it a certain calm disdain, but his perverseness seemed ungrateful, considering the undeniable good usage and indulgence he had received from me.  Again I sat ruminating what I should do.  Mortified as I was at his behavior, and resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my offices, nevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking at my heart, and forbidding me to carry out my purpose, and denouncing me for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter word against this forlornest of mankind.  At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his screen, I sat down and said: "Bartleby, never mind then about revealing your history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as may be with the usages of this office.  Say now you will help to examine papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable:--say so, Bartleby."  "At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable," was his mildly cadaverous reply.  Just then the folding-doors opened, and Nippers approached.  He seemed suffering from an unusually bad night's rest, induced by severer indigestion than common.  He overheard those final words of Bartleby.  "_Prefer not_, eh?" gritted Nippers--"I'd _prefer_ him, if I were you, sir," addressing me--"I'd _prefer_ him; I'd give him preferences, the stubborn mule!  What is it, sir, pray, that he _prefers_ not to do now?"  Bartleby moved not a limb.  "Mr. Nippers," said I, "I'd prefer that you would withdraw for the present."  Somehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this word "prefer" upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions.  And I trembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and seriously affected me in a mental way.  And what further and deeper aberration might it not yet produce?  This apprehension had not been without efficacy in determining me to summary means.  As Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Turkey blandly and deferentially approached.  "With submission, sir," said he, "yesterday I was thinking about Bartleby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart of good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and enabling him to assist in examining his papers."  "So you have got the word too," said I, slightly excited.  "With submission, what word, sir," asked Turkey, respectfully crowding himself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing, making me jostle the scrivener.  "What word, sir?"  "I would prefer to be left alone here," said Bartleby, as if offended at being mobbed in his privacy.  "_That's_ the word, Turkey," said I--"that's it."  "Oh, _prefer_? oh yes--queer word.  I never use it myself.  But, sir, as I was saying, if he would but prefer--"  "Turkey," interrupted I, "you will please withdraw."  "Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should."  As he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a glimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white.  He did not in the least roguishly accent the word prefer.  It was plain that it involuntarily rolled form his tongue.  I thought to myself, surely I must get rid of a demented man, who already has in some degree turned the tongues, if not the heads of myself and clerks.  But I thought it prudent not to break the dismission at once.  The next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window in his dead-wall revery.  Upon asking him why he did not write, he said that he had decided upon doing no more writing.  "Why, how now? what next?" exclaimed I, "do no more writing?"  "No more."  "And what is the reason?"  "Do you not see the reason for yourself," he indifferently replied.  I looked steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull and glazed.  Instantly it occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence in copying by his dim window for the first few weeks of his stay with me might have temporarily impaired his vision.  I was touched.  I said something in condolence with him.  I hinted that of course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and urged him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in the open air.  This, however, he did not do.  A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly to do, Bartleby would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry these letters to the post-office.  But he blankly declined.  So, much to my inconvenience, I went myself.  Still added days went by.  Whether Bartleby's eyes improved or not, I could not say.  To all appearance, I thought they did.  But when I asked him if they did, he vouchsafed no answer.  At all events, he would do no copying.  At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had permanently given up copying.  "What!" exclaimed I; "suppose your eyes should get entirely well--better than ever before--would you not copy then?"  "I have given up copying," he answered, and slid aside.  He remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber.  Nay--if that were possible--he became still more of a fixture than before.  What was to be done?  He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there?  In plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a necklace, but afflictive to bear.  Yet I was sorry for him.  I speak less than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me uneasiness.  If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I would instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat.  But he seemed alone, absolutely alone in the universe.  A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic.  At length, necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other considerations.  Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days' time he must unconditionally leave the office.  I warned him to take measures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode.  I offered to assist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first step towards a removal.  "And when you finally quit me, Bartleby," added I, "I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided.  Six days from this hour, remember."  At the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo! Bartleby was there.  I buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced slowly towards him, touched his shoulder, and said, "The time has come; you must quit this place; I am sorry for you; here is money; but you must go."  "I would prefer not," he replied, with his back still towards me.  "You _must_."  He remained silent.  Now I had an unbounded confidence in this man's common honesty.  He had frequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped upon the floor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button affairs.  The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed extraordinary.  "Bartleby," said I, "I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are thirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.--Will you take it?" and I handed the bills towards him.  But he made no motion.  "I will leave them here then," putting them under a weight on the table. Then taking my hat and cane and going to the door I tranquilly turned and added--"After you have removed your things from these offices, Bartleby, you will of course lock the door--since every one is now gone for the day but you--and if you please, slip your key underneath the mat, so that I may have it in the morning.  I shall not see you again; so good-bye to you.  If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of any service to you, do not fail to advise me by letter.  Good-bye, Bartleby, and fare you well."  But he answered not a word; like the last column of some ruined temple, he remained standing mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise deserted room.  As I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity. I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of Bartleby.  Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any dispassionate thinker.  The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness.  There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any sort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the apartment, jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps.  Nothing of the kind.  Without loudly bidding Bartleby depart--as an inferior genius might have done--I _assumed_ the ground that depart he must; and upon that assumption built all I had to say.  The more I thought over my procedure, the more I was charmed with it.  Nevertheless, next morning, upon awakening, I had my doubts,--I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity.  One of the coolest and wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes in the morning.  My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever.--but only in theory. How it would prove in practice--there was the rub.  It was truly a beautiful thought to have assumed Bartleby's departure; but, after all, that assumption was simply my own, and none of Bartleby's.  The great point was, not whether I had assumed that he would quit me, but whether he would prefer so to do.  He was more a man of preferences than assumptions.  After breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities _pro_ and _con_.  One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and Bartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment it seemed certain that I should see his chair empty.  And so I kept veering about.  At the corner of Broadway and Canal-street, I saw quite an excited group of people standing in earnest conversation.  "I'll take odds he doesn't," said a voice as I passed.  "Doesn't go?--done!" said I, "put up your money."  I was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own, when I remembered that this was an election day.  The words I had overheard bore no reference to Bartleby, but to the success or non-success of some candidate for the mayoralty.  In my intent frame of mind, I had, as it were, imagined that all Broadway shared in my excitement, and were debating the same question with me.  I passed on, very thankful that the uproar of the street screened my momentary absent-mindedness.  As I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office door.  I stood listening for a moment.  All was still.  He must be gone.  I tried the knob.  The door was locked.  Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he indeed must be vanished.  Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I was almost sorry for my brilliant success.  I was fumbling under the door mat for the key, which Bartleby was to have left there for me, when accidentally my knee knocked against a panel, producing a summoning sound, and in response a voice came to me from within--"Not yet; I am occupied."  It was Bartleby.  I was thunderstruck.  For an instant I stood like the man who, pipe in mouth, was killed one cloudless afternoon long ago in Virginia, by a summer lightning; at his own warm open window he was killed, and remained leaning out there upon the dreamy afternoon, till some one touched him, when he fell.  "Not gone!" I murmured at last.  But again obeying that wondrous ascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me, and from which ascendancy, for all my chafing, I could not completely escape, I slowly went down stairs and out into the street, and while walking round the block, considered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity. Turn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away by calling him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an unpleasant idea; and yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph over me,--this too I could not think of.  What was to be done? or, if nothing could be done, was there any thing further that I could _assume_ in the matter?  Yes, as before I had prospectively assumed that Bartleby would depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that departed he was.  In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see Bartleby at all, walk straight against him as if he were air.  Such a proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust.  It was hardly possible that Bartleby could withstand such an application of the doctrine of assumptions.  But upon second thoughts the success of the plan seemed rather dubious.  I resolved to argue the matter over with him again.  "Bartleby," said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe expression, "I am seriously displeased.  I am pained, Bartleby.  I had thought better of you.  I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly organization, that in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would have suffice--in short, an assumption.  But it appears I am deceived.  Why," I added, unaffectedly starting, "you have not even touched that money yet," pointing to it, just where I had left it the evening previous.  He answered nothing.  "Will you, or will you not, quit me?" I now demanded in a sudden passion, advancing close to him.  "I would prefer _not_ to quit you," he replied, gently emphasizing the _not_.  "What earthly right have you to stay here?  Do you pay any rent?  Do you pay my taxes?  Or is this property yours?"  He answered nothing.  "Are you ready to go on and write now?  Are your eyes recovered?  Could you copy a small paper for me this morning? or help examine a few lines? or step round to the post-office?  In a word, will you do any thing at all, to give a coloring to your refusal to depart the premises?"  He silently retired into his hermitage.  I was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but prudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations. Bartleby and I were alone.  I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the latter; and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and imprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares hurried into his fatal act--an act which certainly no man could possibly deplore more than the actor himself.  Often it had occurred to me in my ponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation taken place in the public street, or at a private residence, it would not have terminated as it did.  It was the circumstance of being alone in a solitary office, up stairs, of a building entirely unhallowed by humanizing domestic associations--an uncarpeted office, doubtless, of a dusty, haggard sort of appearance;--this it must have been, which greatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless Colt.  But when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me concerning Bartleby, I grappled him and threw him.  How?  Why, simply by recalling the divine injunction: "A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another."  Yes, this it was that saved me.  Aside from higher considerations, charity often operates as a vastly wise and prudent principle--a great safeguard to its possessor.  Men have committed murder for jealousy's sake, and anger's sake, and hatred's sake, and selfishness' sake, and spiritual pride's sake; but no man that ever I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charity's sake.  Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be enlisted, should, especially with high-tempered men, prompt all beings to charity and philanthropy.  At any rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove to drown my exasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently construing his conduct.  Poor fellow, poor fellow! thought I, he don't mean any thing; and besides, he has seen hard times, and ought to be indulged.  I endeavored also immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to comfort my despondency.  I tried to fancy that in the course of the morning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him,  Bartleby, of his own free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some decided line of march in the direction of the door.  But no.  Half-past twelve o'clock came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his inkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Nippers abated down into quietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple; and Bartleby remained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall reveries.  Will it be credited?  Ought I to acknowledge it?  That afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him.  Some days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a little into "Edwards on the Will," and "Priestly on Necessity."  Under the circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling.  Gradually I slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the scrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and Bartleby was billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence, which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom.  Yes, Bartleby, stay there behind your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no more; you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs; in short, I never feel so private as when I know you are here.  At last I see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life.  I am content.  Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in this world, Bartleby, is to furnish you with office-room for such period as you may see fit to remain.  I believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued with me, had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks obtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited the rooms.  But thus it often is, that the constant friction of illiberal minds wears out at last the best resolves of the more generous.  Though to be sure, when I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my office should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable Bartleby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations concerning him.  Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and calling at my office and finding no one but the scrivener there, would undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Bartleby would remain standing immovable in the middle of the room.  So after contemplating him in that position for a time, the attorney would depart, no wiser than he came.  Also, when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and witnesses and business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal gentleman present, seeing Bartleby wholly unemployed, would request him to run round to his (the legal gentleman's) office and fetch some papers for him.  Thereupon, Bartleby would tranquilly decline, and yet remain idle as before.  Then the lawyer would give a great stare, and turn to me.  And what could I say?  At last I was made aware that all through the circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder was running round, having reference to the strange creature I kept at my office.  This worried me very much.  And as the idea came upon me of his possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my chambers, and denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors; and scandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom over the premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings (for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end perhaps outlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual occupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me more and more, and my friends continually intruded their relentless remarks upon the apparition in my room; a great change was wrought in me.  I resolved to gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of this intolerable incubus.  Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent departure.  In a calm and serious tone, I commended the idea to his careful and mature consideration.  But having taken three days to meditate upon it, he apprised me that his original determination remained the same; in short, that he still preferred to abide with me.  What shall I do?  I now said to myself, buttoning up my coat to the last button.  What shall I do? what ought I to do? what does conscience say I _should_ do with this man, or rather ghost.  Rid myself of him, I must; go, he shall.  But how?  You will not thrust him, the poor, pale, passive mortal,--you will not thrust such a helpless creature out of your door? you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty?  No, I will not, I cannot do that.  Rather would I let him live and die here, and then mason up his remains in the wall.  What then will you do?  For all your coaxing, he will not budge.  Bribes he leaves under your own paperweight on your table; in short, it is quite plain that he prefers to cling to you.  Then something severe, something unusual must be done.  What! surely you will not have him collared by a constable, and commit his innocent pallor to the common jail?  And upon what ground could you procure such a thing to be done?--a vagrant, is he?  What! he a vagrant, a wanderer, who refuses to budge?  It is because he will _not_ be a vagrant, then, that you seek to count him _as_ a vagrant.  That is too absurd.  No visible means of support:  there I have him.  Wrong again:  for indubitably he _does_ support himself, and that is the only unanswerable proof that any man can show of his possessing the means so to do.  No more then.  Since he will not quit me, I must quit him.  I will change my offices; I will move elsewhere; and give him fair notice, that if I find him on my new premises I will then proceed against him as a common trespasser.  Acting accordingly, next day I thus addressed him:  "I find these chambers too far from the City Hall; the air is unwholesome.  In a word, I propose to remove my offices next week, and shall no longer require your services.  I tell you this now, in order that you may seek another place."  He made no reply, and nothing more was said.  On the appointed day I engaged carts and men, proceeded to my chambers, and having but little furniture, every thing was removed in a few hours. Throughout, the scrivener remained standing behind the screen, which I directed to be removed the last thing.  It was withdrawn; and being folded up like a huge folio, left him the motionless occupant of a naked room.  I stood in the entry watching him a moment, while something from within me upbraided me.  I re-entered, with my hand in my pocket--and--and my heart in my mouth.  "Good-bye, Bartleby; I am going--good-bye, and God some way bless you; and take that," slipping something in his hand.  But it dropped upon the floor, and then,--strange to say--I tore myself from him whom I had so longed to be rid of.  Established in my new quarters, for a day or two I kept the door locked, and started at every footfall in the passages.  When I returned to my rooms after any little absence, I would pause at the threshold for an instant, and attentively listen, ere applying my key.  But these fears were needless.  Bartleby never came nigh me.  I thought all was going well, when a perturbed looking stranger visited me, inquiring whether I was the person who had recently occupied rooms at No.--Wall-street.  Full of forebodings, I replied that I was.  "Then sir," said the stranger, who proved a lawyer, "you are responsible for the man you left there.  He refuses to do any copying; he refuses to do any thing; he says he prefers not to; and he refuses to quit the premises."  "I am very sorry, sir," said I, with assumed tranquility, but an inward tremor, "but, really, the man you allude to is nothing to me--he is no relation or apprentice of mine, that you should hold me responsible for him."  "In mercy's name, who is he?"  "I certainly cannot inform you.  I know nothing about him.  Formerly I employed him as a copyist; but he has done nothing for me now for some time past."  "I shall settle him then,--good morning, sir."  Several days passed, and I heard nothing more; and though I often felt a charitable prompting to call at the place and see poor Bartleby, yet a certain squeamishness of I know not what withheld me.  All is over with him, by this time, thought I at last, when through another week no further intelligence reached me.  But coming to my room the day after, I found several persons waiting at my door in a high state of nervous excitement.  "That's the man--here he comes," cried the foremost one, whom I recognized as the lawyer who had previously called upon me alone.  "You must take him away, sir, at once," cried a portly person among them, advancing upon me, and whom I knew to be the landlord of No.--Wall-street.  "These gentlemen, my tenants, cannot stand it any longer; Mr. B--" pointing to the lawyer, "has turned him out of his room, and he now persists in haunting the building generally, sitting upon the banisters of the stairs by day, and sleeping in the entry by night.  Every body is concerned; clients are leaving the offices; some fears are entertained of a mob; something you must do, and that without delay."  Aghast at this torrent, I fell back before it, and would fain have locked myself in my new quarters.  In vain I persisted that Bartleby was nothing to me--no more than to any one else.  In vain:--I was the last person known to have any thing to do with him, and they held me to the terrible account.  Fearful then of being exposed in the papers (as one person present obscurely threatened) I considered the matter, and at length said, that if the lawyer would give me a confidential interview with the scrivener, in his (the lawyer's) own room, I would that afternoon strive my best to rid them of the nuisance they complained of.  Going up stairs to my old haunt, there was Bartleby silently sitting upon the banister at the landing.  "What are you doing here, Bartleby?" said I.  "Sitting upon the banister," he mildly replied.  I motioned him into the lawyer's room, who then left us.  "Bartleby," said I, "are you aware that you are the cause of great tribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry after being dismissed from the office?"  No answer.  "Now one of two things must take place.  Either you must do something, or something must be done to you.  Now what sort of business would you like to engage in?  Would you like to re-engage in copying for some one?"  "No; I would prefer not to make any change."  "Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?"  "There is too much confinement about that.  No, I would not like a clerkship; but I am not particular."  "Too much confinement," I cried, "why you keep yourself confined all the time!"  "I would prefer not to take a clerkship," he rejoined, as if to settle that little item at once.  "How would a bar-tender's business suit you?  There is no trying of the eyesight in that."  "I would not like it at all; though, as I said before, I am not particular."  His unwonted wordiness inspirited me.  I returned to the charge.  "Well then, would you like to travel through the country collecting bills for the merchants?  That would improve your health."  "No, I would prefer to be doing something else."  "How then would going as a companion to Europe, to entertain some young gentleman with your conversation,--how would that suit you?"  "Not at all.  It does not strike me that there is any thing definite about that.  I like to be stationary.  But I am not particular."  "Stationary you shall be then," I cried, now losing all patience, and for the first time in all my exasperating connection with him fairly flying into a passion.  "If you do not go away from these premises before night, I shall feel bound--indeed I _am_ bound--to--to--to quit the premises myself!"  I rather absurdly concluded, knowing not with what possible threat to try to frighten his immobility into compliance. Despairing of all further efforts, I was precipitately leaving him, when a final thought occurred to me--one which had not been wholly unindulged before.  "Bartleby," said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such exciting circumstances, "will you go home with me now--not to my office, but my dwelling--and remain there till we can conclude upon some convenient arrangement for you at our leisure?  Come, let us start now, right away."  "No:  at present I would prefer not to make any change at all."  I answered nothing; but effectually dodging every one by the suddenness and rapidity of my flight, rushed from the building, ran up Wall-street towards Broadway, and jumping into the first omnibus was soon removed from pursuit.  As soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived that I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the demands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own desire and sense of duty, to benefit Bartleby, and shield him from rude persecution.  I now strove to be entirely care-free and quiescent; and my conscience justified me in the attempt; though indeed it was not so successful as I could have wished.  So fearful was I of being again hunted out by the incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants, that, surrendering my business to Nippers, for a few days I drove about the upper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my rockaway; crossed over to Jersey City and Hoboken, and paid fugitive visits to Manhattanville and Astoria.  In fact I almost lived in my rockaway for the time.  When again I entered my office, lo, a note from the landlord lay upon the desk.  I opened it with trembling hands.  It informed me that the writer had sent to the police, and had Bartleby removed to the Tombs as a vagrant.  Moreover, since I knew more about him than any one else, he wished me to appear at that place, and make a suitable statement of the facts.  These tidings had a conflicting effect upon me.  At first I was indignant; but at last almost approved.  The landlord's energetic, summary disposition had led him to adopt a procedure which I do not think I would have decided upon myself; and yet as a last resort, under such peculiar circumstances, it seemed the only plan.  As I afterwards learned, the poor scrivener, when told that he must be conducted to the Tombs, offered not the slightest obstacle, but in his pale unmoving way, silently acquiesced.  Some of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined the party; and headed by one of the constables arm in arm with Bartleby, the silent procession filed its way through all the noise, and heat, and joy of the roaring thoroughfares at noon.  The same day I received the note I went to the Tombs, or to speak more properly, the Halls of Justice.  Seeking the right officer, I stated the purpose of my call, and was informed that the individual I described was indeed within.  I then assured the functionary that Bartleby was a perfectly honest man, and greatly to be compassionated, however unaccountably eccentric.  I narrated all I knew, and closed by suggesting the idea of letting him remain in as indulgent confinement as possible till something less harsh might be done--though indeed I hardly knew what.  At all events, if nothing else could be decided upon, the alms-house must receive him.  I then begged to have an interview.  Being under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and harmless in all his ways, they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison, and especially in the inclosed grass-platted yard thereof.  And so I found him there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face towards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the jail windows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and thieves.  "Bartleby!"  "I know you," he said, without looking round,--"and I want nothing to say to you."  "It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby," said I, keenly pained at his implied suspicion.  "And to you, this should not be so vile a place. Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here.  And see, it is not so sad a place as one might think.  Look, there is the sky, and here is the grass."  "I know where I am," he replied, but would say nothing more, and so I left him.  As I entered the corridor again, a broad meat-like man, in an apron, accosted me, and jerking his thumb over his shoulder said--"Is that your friend?"  "Yes."  "Does he want to starve?  If he does, let him live on the prison fare, that's all."  "Who are you?" asked I, not knowing what to make of such an unofficially speaking person in such a place.  "I am the grub-man.  Such gentlemen as have friends here, hire me to provide them with something good to eat."  "Is this so?" said I, turning to the turnkey.  He said it was.  "Well then," said I, slipping some silver into the grub-man's hands (for so they called him).  "I want you to give particular attention to my friend there; let him have the best dinner you can get.  And you must be as polite to him as possible."  "Introduce me, will you?" said the grub-man, looking at me with an expression which seem to say he was all impatience for an opportunity to give a specimen of his breeding.  Thinking it would prove of benefit to the scrivener, I acquiesced; and asking the grub-man his name, went up with him to Bartleby.  "Bartleby, this is Mr. Cutlets; you will find him very useful to you."  "Your sarvant, sir, your sarvant," said the grub-man, making a low salutation behind his apron.  "Hope you find it pleasant here, sir;--spacious grounds--cool apartments, sir--hope you'll stay with us some time--try to make it agreeable.  May Mrs. Cutlets and I have the pleasure of your company to dinner, sir, in Mrs. Cutlets' private room?"  "I prefer not to dine to-day," said Bartleby, turning away.  "It would disagree with me; I am unused to dinners."  So saying he slowly moved to the other side of the inclosure, and took up a position fronting the dead-wall.  "How's this?" said the grub-man, addressing me with a stare of astonishment.  "He's odd, aint he?"  "I think he is a little deranged," said I, sadly.  "Deranged? deranged is it?  Well now, upon my word, I thought that friend of yourn was a gentleman forger; they are always pale and genteel-like, them forgers.  I can't pity'em--can't help it, sir.  Did you know Monroe Edwards?" he added touchingly, and paused.  Then, laying his hand pityingly on my shoulder, sighed, "he died of consumption at Sing-Sing.  So you weren't acquainted with Monroe?"  "No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers.  But I cannot stop longer.  Look to my friend yonder.  You will not lose by it.  I will see you again."  Some few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and went through the corridors in quest of Bartleby; but without finding him.  "I saw him coming from his cell not long ago," said a turnkey, "may be he's gone to loiter in the yards."  So I went in that direction.  "Are you looking for the silent man?" said another turnkey passing me. "Yonder he lies--sleeping in the yard there.  'Tis not twenty minutes since I saw him lie down."  The yard was entirely quiet.  It was not accessible to the common prisoners.  The surrounding walls, of amazing thickness, kept off all sounds behind them.  The Egyptian character of the masonry weighed upon me with its gloom.  But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot.  The heart of the eternal pyramids, it seemed, wherein, by some strange magic, through the clefts, grass-seed, dropped by birds, had sprung.  Strangely huddled at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, and lying on his side, his head touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted Bartleby.  But nothing stirred.  I paused; then went close up to him; stooped over, and saw that his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed profoundly sleeping.  Something prompted me to touch him.  I felt his hand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my spine to my feet.  The round face of the grub-man peered upon me now.  "His dinner is ready.  Won't he dine to-day, either?  Or does he live without dining?"  "Lives without dining," said I, and closed his eyes.  "Eh!--He's asleep, aint he?"  "With kings and counselors," murmured I.  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  There would seem little need for proceeding further in this history. Imagination will readily supply the meager recital of poor Bartleby's interment.  But ere parting with the reader, let me say, that if this little narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity as to who Bartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the present narrator's making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in such curiosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it.  Yet here I hardly know whether I should divulge one little item of rumor, which came to my ear a few months after the scrivener's decease.  Upon what basis it rested, I could never ascertain; and hence, how true it is I cannot now tell.  But inasmuch as this vague report has not been without certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may prove the same with some others; and so I will briefly mention it.  The report was this:  that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by a change in the administration.  When I think over this rumor, I cannot adequately express the emotions which seize me.  Dead letters! does it not sound like dead men?  Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten it than that of continually handling these dead letters, and assorting them for the flames?  For by the cart-load they are annually burned. Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring:--the finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note sent in swiftest charity:--he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for those who died despairing; hope for those who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved calamities.  On errands of life, these letters speed to death.  Ah Bartleby!  Ah humanity!</p>

Unless we provide otherwise, you accept the revisions and agree to abide by them by continuing to use the Service after the revisions are effective.    AUTHORIZED USER, ACCOUNT USE, AND RESPONSIBILITIES.  You acknowledge that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older and that you have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement. You agree promptly to notify Verizon whenever your personal or billing information changes.   You are responsible for all use of your Service and account, whether by you or someone using your account with or without your permission, including all secondary or sub-accounts associated with your primary account, and to pay for all activity associated with your account. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules regarding your use of the Service and to only use the Service within the United States (unless otherwise permitted by this Agreement).   Restrictions on Use. The Service is a consumer grade service and is not designed for or intended to be used for any commercial purpose. You may not resell, re-provision or rent the Service, (either for a fee or without charge) or allow third parties to use the Service via wired, wireless or other means. For example, you may not provide Internet access to third parties through a wired or wireless connection or use the Service to facilitate public Internet access (such as through a Wi-Fi hotspot), use it for high volume purposes, or engage in similar activities that constitute such use (commercial or non-commercial). If you subscribe to a Broadband Service, you may connect multiple computers/devices within a single home to your modem and/or router to access the Service, but only through a single Verizon-issued IP address. You also may not exceed the bandwidth usage limitations that Verizon may establish from time to time for the Service, or use the Service to host any type of server. Violation of this section may result in bandwidth restrictions on your Service or suspension or termination of your Service.   Dial-Up Accounts. If you subscribe to Dial-up Service, your Service may be subject to log-off automatically and without notice if your account is idle for fifteen minutes. An account session may be deemed to be idle if there appears to be no interactive, human generated data received from your computer system within a prescribed amount of time. Use of automatic re-dialer, script or other programs for the purpose of avoiding inactivity disconnects is a violation of this Agreement. You may only use your account for one log-on session per connection type at a time and you may not use more than one IP address for each log-on session.   Broadband Accounts. Additional User IDs provided for Broadband customers' email boxes may not be used as dial-up connections.    PRIVACY POLICY; LEGAL COMPLIANCE.

Verizon reserves the right to provide account and user information, including email, to third parties as required or permitted by law (such as in response to a subpoena or court order), and to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the investigation of any criminal or civil matter. Such cooperation may include, but is not limited to, monitoring of the Verizon network consistent with applicable law. In addition, Verizon is required by law to report any facts or circumstances reported to us or that we discover from which it appears there may be a violation of the child pornography laws.

AVAILABILITY OF AND CHANGES TO SERVICE.  Service and Bandwidth Availability and Speed. The Service you select may not be available in all areas or at the rates, speeds, or bandwidth generally marketed, and some locations may not qualify for the Service even if initial testing showed that your line was qualified. We will provision qualified HSI lines at the maximum line rate available to your location based on our standard line qualification procedures, unless you have selected a level of service with a lower maximum line rate. Bandwidth is provided on a per-line (not a per-device) basis. The bandwidth available to each device connected to the network will vary depending upon the number, type and configuration of devices using the Service and the type of use (e.g., streaming media), among other factors. The speed of the Service will vary based on network or Internet congestion, your computer configuration, your use of FiOS TV video on demand service, the condition of your telephone line and the wiring inside your location, among other factors. We and our suppliers reserve the right, at any time, with or without prior notice to you, to restrict or suspend the Service to perform maintenance activities and to maintain session control.   Changes to your local voice telephony service. If you change your local telephone company or discontinue your local telephone service, we may in our discretion either terminate your Service or continue to provide Broadband Service without local Verizon voice service at the then-current rates, terms and conditions applicable to your new Service plan and you agree to pay any new or higher monthly fee that may apply to your new Service plan. If we elect to terminate your Service under this Section 6.2, then we reserve the right to charge any early termination fees and to apply the Equipment return terms under Section 9.   Conversion from DSL Service to Verizon FiOS Internet Service. When Verizon is able to provision Service utilizing fiber optic technologies, we may in our discretion terminate your DSL Service and cease offering DSL Service to your location. In such case, we will offer you Verizon FiOS Internet Service at the then applicable rates and terms, which may differ from your previous DSL Service rates and terms. If you are on a Term Plan and Verizon terminates or ceases to offer service to your location under this Section 6.3, you shall not be liable to pay the ETF.   Changes to Service or Features. Verizon reserves the right to change any of the features, Content, equipment authorized by Verizon for use in connection with the Service, or applications of the Service at any time with or without notice to you.

The taxes, fees and other charges detailed in a)-d) above may vary on a monthly basis. Surcharges and recovery fees are not taxes and are not required by law, but are set by Verizon and may change. You also agree to pay any additional charges or fees applied to your account, including interest and charges due to insufficient credit or insufficient funds.    Billing. Non-recurring charges such as set up, activation and installation fees, and certain equipment charges, will be included in your first bill. Monthly Service and Bundled Service recurring charges will be billed one month in advance; any usage charges will be billed in arrears. Pre-paid pricing plans for Additional Services will be billed in advance. Based on your election and subject to our approval, Verizon or its agent will bill you directly, or bill your charge card or local Verizon telephone bill (where available). IF YOU ELECT TO BE BILLED ON YOUR VERIZON PHONE BILL, BY USING THE SERVICES YOU AGREE TO HAVE ALL SERVICE CHARGES INCLUDED ON YOUR PHONE BILL. IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO A BUNDLED SERVICE PLAN, THEN ALL OF THE SERVICES INCLUDED IN THE BUNDLED SERVICE PLAN MUST BE BILLED ON YOUR VERIZON PHONE BILL. If you enroll in Verizon's Paperless Billing program, you agree to view and pay your bill electronically each month and to provide Verizon with current, accurate, complete, and updated information including your legal name, address, telephone number(s), email address and applicable payment data such as your bank account number. You agree to notify Verizon immediately of any changes in your email address or other registration or payment data. You will no longer receive a paper bill. Instead, each month you will receive an email notifying you that your bill is available online for viewing and payment at verizon.com. You must continue to pay your paper bill until you receive your first e-mail notification that your bill is available online. If your electronic payment is rejected for any reason, Verizon may charge a return item fee (where permissible), cancel your enrollment in the Paperless Billing program and resume sending you paper bills. If you wish to revoke consent to paperless billing and receive a paper bill, select the "Account" tab on My Verizon, then select Account Overview, then select "Paperless Billing" and follow the posted instructions. If you use a third party bill payment vendor or distributor to receive and pay your Verizon bill, Verizon is not responsible for the accuracy and timeliness of your bill payments. If you de-enroll from receiving your Verizon bill at your home banking service provider's website, we will resume sending you a paper bill. Billing for Dial-up Service will automatically begin upon registration of your account. Billing for Broadband Services will automatically begin on the date provisioning of your Broadband Service is complete ("Service Ready Date") which will be the Due Date established by Verizon (after the Equipment has been delivered) if you are self-installing the Service. Billing for Additional Services will begin on your Service Ready Date if you are also ordering a new Broadband Service. Otherwise, billing for Additional Services will begin upon submission of your order, unless otherwise noted. We may, at our election, waive any fees or charges. If you cancel any component of a Bundled Services plan, the monthly charges for the remaining services on your account will automatically convert to the applicable existing, non-discounted month-to-month service rate.   Plans with Minimum Terms. If you choose a Service or Bundled Services plan with a minimum term commitment, you agree to maintain your Service for the term of that plan (a "Term Plan"). For Broadband Services, your Term Plan begins on the later of: (a) the date you change your existing Broadband Service plan to a Term Plan; or (b) your Service Ready Date; for Bundled Services, your Term Plan begins once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. You will begin receiving any discount associated with a Bundled Services plan once all Bundled Services have been provisioned. At the end of any Term Plan you may be given the option to select a new Term Plan. If you do not select a new Term Plan, your Service will automatically convert to a month-to-month Service plan at a monthly fee that may be higher than your current rate. If you select a new Term Plan, the terms of that plan will apply.   Pre-paid Service Plans for Additional Services. You may be given the option to select a pre-paid service plan for Additional Services ("Prepaid Service Plan") which will begin on the later of: (a) the date of your order, or (b) the date you change to the Prepaid Service Plan. There will be no refunds for Prepaid Service Plans. At the end of any Prepaid Service Plan, you may be given the option to select a new Prepaid Service Plan. If you do not select a new Prepaid Service Plan, your Service will automatically convert to the then-current month-to-month rate for the Additional Service.   Data Charges You acknowledge and agree that you may also incur data charges or fees from a wireless or internet service provider (which may be Verizon or a third party) for accessing online services or purchasing products and services through interactive options available through the Service. You are solely responsible for all charges or fees payable to Verizon or third parties, including all applicable taxes, and you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to third parties in connection with such transactions.   Money Back Guarantee. If we provide a money back guarantee ("MBG") for your Service, it will begin on your Service Ready Date. During this MBG period you may cancel your Service and receive a full refund of all monthly, one-time and equipment charges paid to Verizon (provided you return all Equipment in good working condition). If you fail to return the Equipment, an unreturned Equipment fee will apply. ETFs will not apply to Service terminated within the MBG period. The MBG does not apply to customers who change between or renew bundle, monthly, term or other pricing plans. The MBG is limited to one per Subscriber per Service type per Service address.   Discontinuation of Service for Nonpayment. We may discontinue your Service without notice if Service charges on your telephone bill or charge card are refused for any reason, or if you fail to make payment when due or to provide us with a new charge card expiration date before the existing date expires.   Late Fees. If any portion of your bill is not paid by the due date, Verizon may charge you a late fee on unpaid balances and may also terminate or suspend your Service without notice. If your charges are billed by your Verizon local carrier, the late fee will be equal to the late payment charge that the local exchange carrier applies. Otherwise, the late fee will be the lesser of 1.5 % per month, or the highest rate permitted by law. If Verizon uses a collection agency or legal action to recover monies due, you agree to reimburse us for all expenses we incur to recover such monies, including attorneys' fees. If you fail to pay on time and Verizon refers your account(s) to a third party for collection, Verizon will charge a collection fee at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, but not to exceed 18 percent, to cover collection-related costs.   Local Telephone, Toll and Long Distance Charges. VERIZON IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CHARGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LONG DISTANCE AND METERED LOCAL OR TOLL CHARGES INCURRED WHEN YOU ACCESS THE SERVICE. YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH THE LOCAL PHONE COMPANY TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DIAL-UP NUMBER YOU HAVE SELECTED IS A LOCAL CALL FROM YOUR LOCATION AND WHETHER ANY CHARGES APPLY. VERIZON DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY DIAL-UP ACCESS NUMBERS WE PROVIDE WILL BE A LOCAL CALL FROM YOUR LOCATION. ADDITIONAL CHARGES, WHICH MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL, APPLY TO REMOTE DIAL UP ACCESS, WHICH IS AVAILABLE FROM CERTAIN LOCATIONS ONLY.   Limitation on Special Pricing Promotions. You may only take advantage of one special pricing promotion during any consecutive twelve (12)-month period. Eligibility for promotional offers may be contingent upon payment of all outstanding Verizon charges.   Refundable Deposit. We may require that you provide us with a refundable deposit, which will be specified at the time of your order ("Subscriber Deposit"). We may also require an additional deposit after activation of the Service if you fail to pay any amounts when due. Within ninety (90) days after termination of your Service, we -will return your Subscriber Deposit, less any unpaid amounts due on your account, including any amounts owed for unreturned or damaged Equipment. Amounts held on deposit will not accrue interest except as required by law.   Credit Related Matters We may evaluate your credit history before modifying or providing you Service. In order to establish an account with us and/or obtain or modify Service, we may obtain a report from a consumer credit agency or exchange information with our affiliates in connection with determining your creditworthiness. If you fail to pay your bill, we may submit a negative credit report to a credit reporting agency, which will negatively affect your credit report.     TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF SERVICE.  Termination of Service.  Subscribers with Month-to-Month Accounts. If you are a month-to-month Service customer, either you or Verizon may terminate this Agreement any time by giving notice to the other as set forth in this Agreement.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF YOUR BROADBAND SERVICE OR ANY COMPONENT OF A BUNDLED SERVICE PLAN IS TERMINATED BY YOU OR BY US AS A RESULT OF VIOLATION BY YOU OF THIS AGREEMENT BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR TERM PLAN, THEN YOU AGREE TO PAY VERIZON THE ETF SET FORTH IN THE PRICING PLAN YOU HAVE CHOSEN. If you terminate Service at your location, your existing Term Plan cannot be carried over to a new Service location.   Termination and/or Suspension by Verizon. Verizon reserves the right to change, limit, terminate, modify or temporarily or permanently cease providing the Service or any part of it with or without prior notice if we elect to change the Service or a part thereof or if you violate the terms of this Agreement. If Verizon terminates your Service under this Section 10.3, you must immediately stop using the Service and you will be responsible for any applicable fees and/or Equipment (or equipment) charges set forth in Sections 9 and 10. If the termination is a result of violation by you of the terms of this Agreement, you also shall be liable to pay the ETF. If Verizon terminates or ceases to offer service to your location, you shall not be liable to pay the ETF. If your Service is reconnected, a reconnection fee may apply.   Deletion of Data upon Termination. YOU AGREE THAT IF YOUR SERVICE IS TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON, VERIZON HAS THE RIGHT TO IMMEDIATELY DELETE ALL DATA, FILES AND OTHER INFORMATION (INCLUDING EMAILS, ADDRESS BOOK AND WEB STORAGE CONTENT) STORED IN OR FOR YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE TO YOU.   Return of Equipment upon Termination. If your HSI Service is terminated for any reason prior to the end of the first year of service and you received Equipment from Verizon, you must return the Equipment to Verizon or you will be charged for the Equipment. Except as set forth below, if your FiOS Internet service is terminated for any reason and you received Equipment, you must return the Equipment to Verizon within 30 days, as instructed by Verizon, or you will be charged for the Equipment. Failure to return any Equipment you received from Verizon, or returning Equipment in a damaged condition (subject only to reasonable wear and tear), will result in the imposition of an Equipment fee that may be substantial. If the Equipment is affixed with a label which includes the following (or similar) message, "PROPERTY OF VERIZON. DO NOT REMOVE FROM PREMISES," then you must not return the Equipment and you will not be charged an Equipment fee as long as the Equipment is left in place in reasonable condition (subject only to reasonable wear and tear).

All obligations of the parties under this Agreement, which, by their nature, would continue beyond the termination of this Agreement, including without limitation, those relating to Limitation of Liability and Indemnification, shall survive such termination.   Verizon will not be liable for delays, damages or failures in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of a governmental body, acts of God, acts of third parties, fires, floods, strikes, work slow-downs or other labor-related activity, or an inability to obtain necessary equipment or services.   You may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement, or your rights or obligations under it, in whole or in part, to any other person. Any attempt to do so shall be void. We may freely assign all or any part of this Agreement with or without notice and you agree to make all subsequent payments as directed.   Except as otherwise required by law, you and Verizon agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and the substantive laws of the state of the customer’s billing address, without reference to its principles of conflicts of laws, will be applied to govern, construe and enforce all of the rights and duties of the parties arising from or relating in any way to the subject matter of this Agreement. UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, YOU AND VERIZON CONSENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF AND VENUE IN AN ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF THE CUSTOMER’S BILLING ADDRESS FOR ANY SUITS OR CAUSES OF ACTION CONNECTED IN ANY WAY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TO THE SERVICE. Except as otherwise required by law, including state laws relating to consumer transactions, any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Service must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action is barred.

Any export of the Software is strictly prohibited.   Verizon's failure at any time to insist upon strict compliance with any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such terms in the future. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the unenforceable portion shall be construed as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties.   This Agreement, including all Policies referred to herein and posted on the Website, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Verizon with respect to the subject matter hereto and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements whether written or oral. No changes by you to this Agreement shall be effective unless agreed to in a writing signed by an authorized person at Verizon.    VOLUNTARY MEDIATION  Verizon offers customers the option of participating in a free internal mediation program. This program is entirely voluntary and does not affect either party's rights in any other aspect of the dispute resolution procedures outlined in Section 19. In our voluntary mediation program, we will assign an employee who is not directly involved in the dispute to help both sides reach an agreement. That person has all the rights and protections of a mediator and the process has all of the protections associated with mediation. For example, nothing said in the mediation can be used later in an arbitration or lawsuit. If you would like to know more, or you would like to start the mediation process, please contact us at NoticeofDispute@verizon.com or through Verizon Online Dispute Resolution Manager, One Verizon Way, VC54N090, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920, for a notice of customer dispute form.

ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS ACTIONS.  WE HOPE TO MAKE YOU A HAPPY CUSTOMER, BUT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, THIS SECTION OUTLINES WHAT'S EXPECTED OF BOTH OF US. YOU AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND THE PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD. IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT:  THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT CASES THAT QUALIFY, ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) WILL BE RESOLVED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA"). YOU CAN ALSO BRING ANY ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ("BBB"), ATTENTION OF FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND IF THE LAW ALLOWS, THEY CAN SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US FOR YOU.  2.	UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR BILLING ADDRESS. FOR CLAIMS OVER $10,000, THE AAA'S ARBITRATION RULES WILL APPLY; IN SUCH CASES, THE LOSER CAN ASK FOR A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS TO REVIEW THE AWARD. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, THE PARTY BRINGING THE CLAIM CAN CHOOSE THE AAA'S RULES FOR BINDING ARBITRATION OR, ALTERNATIVELY, CAN BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU CAN GET PROCEDURES, RULES AND FEE INFORMATION FROM THE AAA (WWW.ADR.ORG), OR FROM US. FOR CLAIMS OF $10,000 OR LESS, YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE THE ARBITRATION CARRIED OUT BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR, OR BY A HEARING IN–PERSON OR BY PHONE.  THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE AAAPROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DETERMINE THAT CLASS ARBITRATION IS PERMISSIBLE. THE ARBITRATOR ALSO SHALL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO PRESIDE OVER CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, OR TO AWARD ANY FORM OF CLASSWIDE OR COLLECTIVE REMEDY. INSTEAD, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE POWER TO AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. NO AAA RULE WILL APPLY IF IT CONFLICTS WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY CONTRARY PROVISION IN THE AAA OR BBB RULES, THE ARBITRATOR WILL BE BOUND TO APPLY LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT, AND DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD ANY RELIEF THAT IS NOT AUTHORIZED BY SUCH LAWS.  IF EITHER OF US INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE ARBITRATION. NOTICE TO VERIZON SHOULD BE SENT TO NOTICEOFDISPUTE@VERIZON.COM OR TO VERIZON DISPUTE RESOLUTION MANAGER, ONE VERIZON WAY, VC54N090, BASKING RIDGE, NJ 07920. THE NOTICE MUST DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM AND THE RELIEF BEING SOUGHT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE WITHIN 30 DAYS, EITHER PARTY MAY THEN PROCEED TO FILE A CLAIM FOR ARBITRATION. VERIZON WILL PAY ANY FILING FEE THAT THE AAA OR BBB CHARGES YOU FOR ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE. IF YOU PROVIDE US WITH SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE THAT YOU CANNOT PAY THE FILING FEE, VERIZON WILL PAY THE FEE DIRECTLY TO THE AAA OR BBB. IF THAT ARBITRATION PROCEEDS, WE'LL ALSO PAY ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES CHARGED LATER, AS WELL AS FOR ANY APPEAL TO A PANEL OF THREE NEW ARBITRATORS (IF THE ARBITRATION AWARD IS APPEALABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT).  WE MAY, BUT ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO, MAKE A WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER ANYTIME BEFORE ARBITRATION BEGINS. THE AMOUNT OR TERMS OF ANY SETTLEMENT OFFER MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THE ARBITRATOR UNTIL AFTER THE ARBITRATOR ISSUES AN AWARD ON THE CLAIM. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE OFFER AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS MORE THAN OUR OFFER BUT LESS THAN $5000, OR IF WE DO NOT MAKE YOU AN OFFER, AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT LESS THAN $5000, THEN WE AGREE TO PAY YOU $5000 INSTEAD OF THE AMOUNT AWARDED. IN THAT CASE WE ALSO AGREE TO PAY ANY REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAW REQUIRES IT FOR YOUR CASE. IF THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU MORE THAN $5000, THEN WE WILL PAY YOU THAT AMOUNT.  AN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE; IT CANNOT BE USED IN ANY OTHER CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARD ITSELF.  IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS SET FORTH IN SUBSECTION 18.3 CANNOT BE ENFORCED, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY.  IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND VERIZON AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND VERIZON UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

  <p>8,305 words</p>
  <p class="tiny">CONDITIONS OF CARRIAGE Your ticket and the following Conditions of Carriage constitute the contract between you, the passenger, and American Airlines, Inc. ("American") and apply to all transportation provided by American (including transportation on codeshare partners*) between points in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with the Department of Transportation. See International General Rules Tariff. On some international itineraries, taxes and fees are added to the price of the ticket. Every price offered by American is the full price, which consists of the base fare, applicable carrier-imposed fees (such as surcharges), and government-imposed taxes and fees. On average, for the year ended March 31, 2012, our passengers paid $349.70 in taxes and fees (where applicable) as part of their ticket price.  American will act as an agent to issue tickets, check baggage and book reservations for transportation via other carriers which have interline agreements with American. Other carriers may have different terms and conditions applicable to their flights. These may be obtained directly from the other carriers.  Please read your contract carefully.  American Airlines, Inc. P.O.

When reduced fares are for sale for a limited period of time, American reserves the right to decline to issue refunds. For non-refundable fares, the passenger will receive the difference in the fares in the form of a non-refundable American travel voucher valid only for purchase of air transportation on American, and must be used within one (1) year of issuance.  *Note - the purchase of a Prepaid Ticket will constitute purchase of a ticket.  If American increases the price for the transportation, an additional collection may be made for:  Any segments where you change your flight to a different time, date or routing from that shown on your ticket, and Any segment shown as "open" on your ticket. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCHEDULES AND OPERATIONS American will endeavor to carry you and your baggage with reasonable dispatch, but times shown in timetables or elsewhere are not guaranteed and form no part of this contract. American may, without notice, substitute alternate carriers or aircraft and, if necessary, may alter or omit stopping places shown on the ticket. Schedules are subject to change without notice. American is not responsible for or liable for failure to make connections, or to operate any flight according to schedule, or for a change to the schedule of any flight. Under no circumstances shall American be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages arising from the foregoing.  Return to Top  FORCE MAJEURE EVENTS American may, in the event of a force majeure event, without notice, cancel, terminate, divert, postpone or delay any flight or the right of carriage or reservation of traffic accommodations without liability except to issue an involuntary refund. The involuntary refund will be made in the original form of payment in accordance with involuntary refund rules for any unused portion of the ticket. American will also reserve the right to determine if any departure or landing should be made without any liability except the afore mentioned involuntary refund.  Force Majeure Event Means:  Any condition beyond American's control including, but without limitation, meteorological conditions, acts of God, riots, civil commotion, embargoes, wars, hostilities, disturbances or unsettled international conditions - actual threatened or reported. Also, because of any delay, demand, circumstances or requirement due, directly or indirectly to such conditions, or Any strike, work stoppage, slowdown, lockout or any other labor related dispute involving or affecting American's service, or Any government regulation, demand or requirement, or Any shortage of labor, fuel or facilities of American or others, or Any fact not reasonably foreseen, anticipated or predicted by American. Return to Top  OVERSALES If a flight is oversold (more passengers hold confirmed reservations than there are seats available), no one may be denied boarding against his or her will until airline personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservation willingly, in exchange for compensation of the airline’s choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, other passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily in accordance with the following boarding priority of American. In such events, American will usually deny boarding based upon check-in time, but we may also consider factors such as severe hardships, fare paid, and status within the AAdvantage® program.  If you are denied boarding involuntarily, you are entitled to a payment of ‘‘denied boarding compensation’’ from the airline unless:  You have not fully complied with the airline’s ticketing, check-in and reconfirmation requirements, or you are not acceptable for transportation under the airline’s usual rules and practices; or You are denied boarding because the flight is canceled; or You are denied boarding because a smaller capacity aircraft was substituted for safety or operational reasons; or On a flight operated with an aircraft having 60 or fewer seats, you are denied boarding due to safety-related weight/balance restrictions that limit payload; or You are offered accommodations in a section of the aircraft other than specified in your ticket, at no extra charge (a passenger seated in a section for which a lower fare is charged must be given an appropriate refund); or The airline is able to place you on another flight or flights that are planned to reach your next stopover or final destination within one hour of the planned arrival time of your original flight.

Baggage will not be released unless all sums due American are paid. Baggage claim checks must be returned to American on request. American is not responsible to determine that the holder of the claim check is entitled to the baggage. If baggage claim checks are lost, proof of ownership may be required prior to release of the baggage.  In the event your checked bags do not arrive on your flight, reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that the bag is returned to you within 24 hours for flights within the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our goal to return bags within 24 hours applies only when we are the carrier taking you to your final destination.  Listed below are some circumstances that may inhibit our ability to return your bags within 24 hours:  No local name/address/phone numbers are provided You are located at a remote location or an /unreachable/ address, such as a cruise ship or a camping site You changed your delivery address, but did not notify us We have limited flight schedules to your destination Operational circumstances prevent American airlines or American Eagle from being able to locate or deliver your bags within this time frame. Carry-on Baggage The suitability of carry-on baggage will be determined by American. Each customer will be limited to one carry-on bag and one personal item. A personal item includes a purse, briefcase, laptop, or small book bag style backpack. A personal item must fit under the seat. Fragile or valuable items, such as keys, medication or computers should be carried in your personal item.  At times, additional limits may be placed on carry-on baggage based on the main cabin stowage capacity of specific aircraft, which can result in carry-on bags being checked in the boarding area. In the event it is necessary to check carry-on bags, ensure that fragile or valuable items, such as keys, medication or computers are carried in your personal item. If government regulations are more restrictive, such restrictions shall apply.  A carry-on bag must fit in the bag sizer and not exceed overall dimensions of 45 inches (length + width + height). The maximum combined linear measurement of the carry-on bag cannot exceed any of the following measurements: 22" long x 14" wide x 9" tall or 114cm (56 x 35 x 23 cm). All carry-on items must fit under the seat or in an overhead bin.  Note: A garment bag (which fits in the bag sizer) will count as the passenger's carry-on bag.  On American Eagle flights each customer is limited to a personal item in the cabin, but their carry-on item (not exceeding 45 dimensional inches) will be valet checked at the gate or planeside.  Carry-on items which appear too large or irregularly shaped to fit under a seat, in an overhead compartment, or in a closet or luggage rack will not be accepted for passenger cabin stowage.  Any mobility aid or assistive device that is approved for in-cabin transport on American, and is carried by a qualified disabled passenger, is accepted free of charge and is in addition to normal baggage allowances, provided such aid or device fits in an approved stowage space.  All baggage must be completely stowed before the airplane may depart the gate.  Checked Baggage Checked baggage charges apply to the first and second checked bag. Some exceptions apply. Excess bag charges apply for more than two checked bags. Oversize and overweight charges apply to baggage over the free size and weight allowance. Specialty items may have additional charges or exceptions to baggage charges.  Hazardous Items Hazardous materials will not be accepted as baggage except for limited amounts of dry ice subject to Americans rules. See Restricted Items.  Firearms Firearms and ammunition will be accepted only as checked baggage, subject to American's rules. See Transporting Firearms and Ammunition.  Live Animals Pets (cats and dogs only) will be accepted as baggage when confined in a container, subject to American's rules and charges. Service animals to detect explosives and drugs and dogs for search and rescue will be accepted in the passenger cabin subject to American's rules and charges. See Pets.

Liability American's liability for loss, damage or delayed delivery of checked baggage, including transfer baggage, is limited to the actual value of the baggage or $3,300 (the amount will increase to $3,400 for travel beginning on June 6, 2013 ), whichever is less, unless the passenger declares a higher value for loss of baggage, not to exceed $5000.00 including the $3,300 (the amount will increase to $3,400 for travel beginning on June 6, 2013 ) standard liability per passenger and pays American a sum of $2.00 per $100.00 (or any portion thereof) of excess value. Excess valuation coverage is not available for and does not apply to items excluded in our liability below. See Additional Insurance.  American does not assume liability for any of the following items in or as checked baggage: antiques, artifacts, artwork, books and documents, china, computers and other electronic equipment, computer software, fragile items (including child/infant restraint devices such as strollers and car seats), eyeglasses, prescription sunglasses, non-prescription sunglasses and all other eyewear and eye/vision devices whether lenses are glass, plastic, or some other material, furs, heirlooms, keys, liquids, medicines, money, orthotics, surgical supports, perishable items, photographic, video and optical equipment, precious metals, stones or jewelry, securities and negotiable papers, silverware, samples, unique or irreplaceable items or any other similar valuable items.  With the exception of strollers, American does not accept these items in or as checked baggage and assumes no responsibility or liability for such items, regardless of whether American knew or should have known of the presence of such items in checked or transferred baggage. If any such items are lost, damaged or delayed, you will not be entitled to any reimbursement under American's standard baggage liability, or under any declared excess valuation. Do not attempt to check these items. Carry them with you in the passenger cabin (subject to carry-on baggage limitations). Fully collapsible strollers may be carried on board with the passenger as long as they fit in an overhead bin. Strollers exceeding a maximum weight of 20lbs or that are not capable of being transported inside the cabin due to size must be checked at a ticket counter. American will not assume liability for strollers that are not checked in original and/or suitable packaging for safe transport.  American assumes no responsibility for loss, damage or delayed delivery of baggage not acceptable for transportation by American as checked baggage and items damaged as a result of items contained in checked or transferred baggage.  Customers with disabilities traveling with wheelchairs or other mobility devices are exempt from liability restrictions for loss, damage or delays to these items.  American assumes no liability for articles carried in the passenger cabin.  American assumes no liability for minor damage such as scratches, scuffs, stains, dents, cuts and dirt resulting from normal wear and tear.  American assumes no liability for musical instruments/recreational/sports items not presented in a hard-sided case.  American is not responsible for damage to contents if the outside of the hard-sided case is not damaged.  American assumes no responsibility for damage to or loss of protruding baggage parts such as wheels, straps, pockets, pull handles, hanger hooks or other items attached to the baggage.  American assumes no liability for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive or special damages resulting from loss, damage or delayed delivery of checked or transferred baggage, including, without limitation, damages for lost revenue or profits, loss of use or business interruption.  We may disallow any claim for loss or damage which contains misrepresentations, including false statements concerning whether or not the passenger has made previous claims with American or other carriers and/or where the passenger fails to have the carrier's baggage claim declaration form notarized. AA may also disallow claims when the passenger fails to provide proof of loss in the form of receipts of purchase.  Legal Action Legal action premised on or related to damage, delay or loss must be commenced within two years of the date of the incident.  Missing Items Items missing from checked baggage must be reported to American before leaving the airport or within 24 hours of the receipt of the bag.  Loss/Delay In the case of delay or loss, an initial complaint must be presented to American prior to leaving the arrival airport for which the baggage was checked or should have been checked. At the latest, such initial report must be made within four hours of the arrival of the flight on which the passenger traveled. For passengers purchasing the American Airlines baggage delivery service provided through BAGS VIP Luggage Delivery in advance of travel, the initial report must be made within 12 hours of the arrival of the flight on which the passenger traveled.  If compensation is sought for a delay or loss, a written claim, in the form provided by American, must be received by American no later than thirty days after the initial report was presented and recorded by American.  Damaged Baggage No action shall lie in the case of damage to baggage unless the person entitled to delivery files an initial report with American prior to leaving the arrival airport, or at the latest, within 24 hours from the date of receipt of the baggage.  After the initial report of damage to American, the damaged property must be presented to American for repair within thirty days from the date of the initial report of damage to American.  Claims Failure to report delayed or damaged baggage or missing contents within the prescribed time limit releases American from liability.

Return to Top  REFUNDS General Refunds Some tickets are non-refundable. If you have a refundable ticket, American will issue a refund as follows.  If the ticket is totally unused, the full amount paid will be refunded.  If the ticket is partially used, the refund will be the difference between the fare paid and the fare for the transportation actually used as determined by the applicable rules.  In addition, if the ticket to be refunded is no longer valid for transportation, an administrative service charge will be assessed upon refund of the ticket. This service charge will be collected by deducting the applicable service charge from the amount which otherwise would be refunded. Tickets will be refunded only to the person named on the ticket as passenger, except that:  Tickets purchased with a credit card will be refunded only as a credit to the credit card account, Tickets issued against a prepaid ticket advice will be refunded only to the purchaser, and Tickets issued against a government transportation request will be refunded only to the government agency which issued the transportation request. Once travel has commenced, refund requests for lower fares will not be honored.  American will strive to process eligible refunds in the time frames set out below, upon receipt of all required information.  For all eligible paper and electronic tickets purchased within the U.S. with a credit card or cash, refunds will be provided within 7 business days of receipt of the required refund information. The credit card refund may take up to two billing cycles before appearing on a credit card statement, so you should contact your credit card company directly to verify receipt of the credit. Tickets purchased with a check will be refunded within 20 days of receipt of the required information.  Refunds for electronic tickets may be obtained through the refund section on our website at AA.com or by contacting American Airlines reservations.

Box 200025 El Paso, Texas 88520-0025 Certain refund requests cannot be accommodated in the time frames discussed above. For example, refunds for lost tickets must be held for 90 days to ensure that they are not found and used. Tickets with adjustments (for example, a customer buys a first class ticket but actually travels in the main or coach cabin) require that we verify the itinerary and class of service flown, and this can take up to 45 days. Tickets that were purchased outside the U.S. require special handling because we must ensure that currency conversion rates are calculated correctly.  Refund for credit card purchases will be made only to the credit card account.  Service charges are collected for some refunds e.g., lost tickets.  American assumes no liability for any special, incidental, or consequential damages for instances in which we do not meet our goals for processing refunds.

CUSTOMERS WITH DISABILITIES American endeavors to provide passengers with disabilities dignified, professional, and courteous service at all times. We have a team of employees who regularly consult with disability advisory groups on the quality of our service.  Reservations Special Assistance Coordinators American reservations offices maintain a staff of Special Assistance Coordinators (SAC) who work with customers who have identified themselves as having disabilities. The reservations representative who responds to the customer's initial call passes pertinent information to a SAC who calls the customer back. A toll-free number exists for customers with disabilities to follow-up on travel arrangements with the SAC office. Airport and in-flight personnel are notified of special service requests.  Pre-Reserved Seats American blocks a limited number of seats on each aircraft to accommodate customers who identify themselves as having a qualified disability. Adjacent seats are provided, under certain circumstances, for customers with disabilities who must travel with a companion for assistance.  Assistive Devices American accepts motorized and non-motorized assistive devices for transport. When necessary, we will disassemble and reassemble wheelchairs or assistive devices for customers when they travel. American provides storage for one passenger's collapsible, manual wheelchair in the cabin of each jet aircraft. This service is available on a first-come, first served basis, and has priority over carry-on baggage belonging to other customers who board at the same city, provided the customer follows the pre-boarding procedure. In-cabin stowage space for assistive devices cannot be pre-reserved, but American accepts carry-on wheelchairs, provided they collapse to fit in an overhead bin or under a seat. Non-collapsible wheelchairs/scooters are accepted as checked baggage. These items can be checked at the main ticket counter or the departure gate. American offers a special wheelchair service that allows you to check your wheelchair at the departure gate and claim it at your arrival gate free of charge. Although you can arrange to claim your chair at the connecting city we recommend that the chair be checked through to the final destination. The additional time required to claim and re-check your chair at the connecting city may compromise your ability to make your connection. American has wheelchairs and our representatives provide wheelchair service at connecting airports. Please let us know you will need this assistance when making your reservation. Assistive devices approved for cabin transport do not count towards the combined number of checked and carry-on baggage a passenger is allowed, nor do they count towards the limit of carry-on items you may bring on board.  Boarding Assistance If you have special needs, upon request, pre-boarding assistance will be provided to you, allowing you the opportunity to be seated prior to general boarding. A special aisle chair is available to assist you if you are unable to walk, and all of our jet aircraft are equipped with specially designed seats that feature moveable aisle armrests to help make seating easier.  Medical Oxygen Only portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) approved by the FAA are accepted for inflight medical oxygen. A 48-hour notice is required. Contact American Airlines at 1-800-433-7300 to obtain information regarding the required medical paperwork.  Complaint Resolution Officials for Customers with Special Needs We have employees at airports who are trained as local complaint resolution officials (LCRO) and are available during operating hours. A corporate complaint resolution official is available to assist LCROs 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

  <h1>Charlotte Perkins Gilman, “The Yellow Wall Paper”</h1>
  <p>6,121 words</p>
  <p class="tiny">The Yellow Wall Paper THE YELLOW WALL PAPER   THE  YELLOW WALL PAPER  BY CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON    The Yellow Wall Paper pg 7.jpg  BOSTON SMALL, MAYNARD & COMPANY MCMI   Copyright, 1892 By New England Magazine Corporation  Copyright, 1899 By Small, Maynard & Company    Rockwell & Churchill Press Boston, U.S.A.     This story is reprinted from The New England Magazine of January, 1892, by permission of the publisher, to whom the thanks of the Author are due. The cover design is by Mr. E. B. Bird.   THE YELLOW WALL PAPER    IT is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer.  A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity, — but that would be asking too much of fate!  Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.  Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?  John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.  John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.  John is a physician, and perhaps — (I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind) — perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.  You see, he does not believe I am sick!  And what can one do?  If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression, — a slight hysterical tendency, — what is one to do?  My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same thing.  So I take phosphates or phosphites, — whichever it is, — and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to "work" until I am well again.  Personally I disagree with their ideas.  Personally I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good.  But what is one to do?  I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good deal — having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.  I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus — but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.  So I will let it alone and talk about the house.  The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.  There is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden — large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them.  There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.  There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.  That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don't care — there is something strange about the house — I can feel it.  I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a draught, and shut the window.  I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.  But John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself, — before him, at least,—and that makes me very tired.  I don't like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty, old-fashioned chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.  He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another.  He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction.  I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.  He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. "Your exercise depends on your strength, my dear," said he, "and your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time." So we took the nursery, at the top of the house.  It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then playground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.  The paint and paper look as if a boys' school had used it. It is stripped off — the paper — in great patches all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.  One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin.  It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame, uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide — plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard-of contradictions.  The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.  It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others.  No wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long.  There comes John, and I must put this away, — he hates to have me write a word.    We have been here two weeks, and I haven't felt like writing before, since that first day. I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.  John is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.  I am glad my case is not serious!  But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.  John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no reason to suffer, and that satisfies him.  Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way!  I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already!  Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able — to dress and entertain, and order things.  It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!  And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.  I suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this wall paper!  At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.  He said that after the wall paper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of the stairs, and so on.  "You know the place is doing you good," he said, "and really, dear, I don't care to renovate the house just for a three months' rental."  "Then do let us go downstairs," I said, "there are such pretty rooms there."  Then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into the bargain.  But he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.  It is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of course, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.  I'm really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper.  Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.  Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.  I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.  But I find I get pretty tired when I try.  It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.  I wish I could get well faster.  But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had!  There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.  I got positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths didn't match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other.  I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy-store.  I remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.  I used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could always hop into that chair and be safe.  The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for we had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I never saw such ravages as the children have made here.  The wall paper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother — they must have had perseverance as well as hatred.  Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is all we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.  But I don't mind it a bit — only the paper.  There comes John's sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of me! I must not let her find me writing.  She is a perfect, an enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better profession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me sick!  But I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these windows.  There is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road, and one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of great elms and velvet meadows.  This wall paper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.  But in the places where it isn't faded, and where the sun is just so, I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.  There's sister on the stairs!    Well, the Fourth of July is over! The people are all gone and I am tired out. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week. Of course I didn't do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.  But it tired me all the same.  John says if I don't pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall.  But I don't want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!  Besides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.  I don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything, and I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.  I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.  Of course I don't when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am alone.  And I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.  So I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.  I'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall paper. Perhaps because of the wall paper.  It dwells in my mind so!  I lie here on this great immovable bed — it is nailed down, I believe — and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I assure you. I start, we'll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion.  I know a little of the principles of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.  It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.  Looked at in one way, each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and flourishes — a kind of "debased Romanesque" with delirium tremens — go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.  But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase.  The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction.  They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion.  There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when the cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can almost fancy radiation, after all, — the interminable grotesques seem to form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal distraction.  It makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap, I guess.    I don't know why I should write this. I don't want to.  I don't feel able.  And I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and think in some way — it is such a relief!  But the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.  Half the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.  John says I mustn't lose my strength, and has me take cod-liver oil and lots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.  Dear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell him how I wished he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and Julia.  But he said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished.  It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this nervous weakness, I suppose.  And dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till he tired my head.  He said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.  He says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and self-control and not let my silly fancies run away with me.  There's one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to occupy this nursery with the horrid wall paper.  If we had not used it that blessed child would have! What a fortunate escape! Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, live in such a room for worlds.  I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here, after all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.  Of course I never mention it to them any more, — I am too wise, — but I keep watch of it all the same.  There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.  Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.  It is always the same shape, only very numerous.  And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. I don't like it a bit. I wonder — I begin to think — I wish John would take me away from here!    It is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise, and because he loves me so. But I tried it last night.  It was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.  I hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by one window or another.  John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wall paper till I felt creepy.  The faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she wanted to get out.  I got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and when I came back John was awake.  "What is it, little girl?" he said. "Don't go walking about like that — you'll get cold."  I thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was not gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.  "Why, darling!" said he, "our lease will be up in three weeks, and I can't see how to leave before.  "The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but you really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is better. I feel really much easier about you."  "I don't weigh a bit more," said I, "nor as much; and my appetite may be better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the morning, when you are away."  "Bless her little heart!" said he with a big hug; "she shall be as sick as she pleases. But now let's improve the shining hours by going to sleep, and talk about it in the morning."  "And you won't go away?" I asked gloomily.  "Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house ready. Really, dear, you are better!"  "Better in body, perhaps" — I began, and stopped short, for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I could not say another word.  "My darling," said he, "I beg of you, for my sake and for our child's sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?"  So of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before long. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn't, — I lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern really did move together or separately.    On a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind. The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing.  You think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in following, it turns a back somersault, and there you are. It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad dream.  The outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus. If you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions, — why, that is something like it.  That is, sometimes!  There is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.  When the sun shoots in through the east window — I always watch for that first long, straight ray — it changes so quickly that I never can quite believe it.  That is why I watch it always.  By moonlight — the moon shines in all night when there is a moon — I wouldn't know it was the same paper.  At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and worst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern, I mean, and the woman behind it is as plain as can be.  I didn't realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind, — that dim sub-pattern, — but now I am quite sure it is a woman.  By daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps her so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.  I lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep all I can.  Indeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each meal.  It is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don't sleep.  And that cultivates deceit, for I don't tell them I'm awake, — oh, no!  The fact is, I am getting a little afraid of John.  He seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.  It strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that perhaps it is the paper!  I have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I've caught him several times looking at the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with her hand on it once.  She didn't know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a very quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing, and looked quite angry — asked me why I should frighten her so!  Then she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John's, and she wished we would be more careful!  Did not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern, and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!    Life is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat better, and am more quiet than I was. John is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall paper.  I turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was because of the wall paper — he would make fun of me. He might even want to take me away.  I don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week more, and I think that will be enough.  I'm feeling ever so much better! I don't sleep much at night, for it is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.  In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.  There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously.  It is the strangest yellow, that wall paper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw — not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.  But there is something else about that paper — the smell! I noticed it the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was not bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows are open or not the smell is here.  It creeps all over the house.  I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.  It gets into my hair.  Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it — there is that smell!  Such a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it, to find what it smelled like.  It is not bad — at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I ever met.  In this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me.  It used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the house — to reach the smell.  But now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like is the color of the paper — a yellow smell!  There is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A streak that runs around the room. It goes behind every piece of furniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had been rubbed over and over.  I wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round and round and round — round and round and round — it makes me dizzy!    I really have discovered something at last. Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.  The front pattern does move — and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!  Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.  Then in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.  And she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb through that pattern — it strangles so; I think that is why it has so many heads.  They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside-down, and makes their eyes white!  If those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.    I think that woman gets out in the daytime! And I'll tell you why — privately — I've seen her!  I can see her out of every one of my windows!  It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women do not creep by daylight.  I see her in that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in those dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.  I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.  I don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight!  I always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can't do it at night, for I know John would suspect something at once.  And John is so queer, now, that I don't want to irritate him. I wish he would take another room! Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself.  I often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.  But, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.  And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can turn!  I have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.    If only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean to try it, little by little. I have found out another funny thing, but I shan't tell it this time! It does not do to trust people too much.  There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John is beginning to notice. I don't like the look in his eyes.  And I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She had a very good report to give.  She said I slept a good deal in the daytime.  John knows I don't sleep very well at night, for all I'm so quiet!  He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving and kind.  As if I couldn't see through him!  Still, I don't wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three months.  It only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly affected by it.    Hurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town over night, and won't be out until this evening. Jennie wanted to sleep with me — the sly thing! but I told her I should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.  That was clever, for really I wasn't alone a bit! As soon as it was moonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I got up and ran to help her.  I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper.  A strip about as high as my head and half around the room.  And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me I declared I would finish it today!  We go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to leave things as they were before.  Jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.  She laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself, but I must not get tired.  How she betrayed herself that time!  But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me — not alive!  She tried to get me out of the room — it was too patent! But I said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner — I would call when I woke.  So now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone, and there is nothing left but that great bed-stead nailed down, with the canvas mattress we found on it.  We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.  I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.  How those children did tear about here!  This bedstead is fairly gnawed!  But I must get to work.  I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.  I don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, till John comes.  I want to astonish him.  I've got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!  But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!  This bed will not move!  I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I bit off a little piece at one corner — but it hurt my teeth.  Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision!  I am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to try.  Besides, I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued.  I don't like to look out of the windows even — there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast.  I wonder if they all come out of that wall paper, as I did?  But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope — you don't get me out in the road there!  I suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night, and that is hard!  It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please!  I don't want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennie asks me to.  For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow.  But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.  Why, there's John at the door!  It is no use, young man, you can't open it!  How he does call and pound!  Now he's crying for an axe.  It would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!  "John, dear!" said I in the gentlest voice, "the key is down by the front steps, under a plantain leaf!"  That silenced him for a few moments.  Then he said — very quietly indeed, "Open the door, my darling!"  "I can't," said I. "The key is down by the front door, under a plantain leaf!"  And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course, and came in. He stopped short by the door.  "What is the matter?" he cried. "For God's sake, what are you doing?"  I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.  "I've got out at last," said I, "in spite of you and Jane! And I've pulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!"  Now why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my path by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!</p>

  <h1>Facebook Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</h1>
  <p>4,555 words</p>
  <p class="tiny">Statement of Rights and Responsibilities  This agreement was written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.  Please note that Section 17 contains certain changes to the general terms for users outside the United States.  Date of Last Revision: November 15, 2013.  Statement of Rights and Responsibilities  This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the Facebook Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 14 below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Facebook works.  Privacy  Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Use Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information.  We encourage you to read the Data Use Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.   Sharing Your Content and Information  You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition: For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others). When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Use Policy and Platform Page.) When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture). We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).   Safety  We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep Facebook safe, which includes the following commitments by you: You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook. You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our prior permission. You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook. You will not upload viruses or other malicious code. You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else. You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user. You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence. You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related, dating or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions. You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (“promotion”) on Facebook. You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory. You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of Facebook, such as a denial of service attack or interference with page rendering or other Facebook functionality. You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement or our policies.   Registration and Account Security  Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account: You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission. You will not create more than one personal account. If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission. You will not use your personal timeline primarily for your own commercial gain, and will use a Facebook Page for such purposes. You will not use Facebook if you are under 13. You will not use Facebook if you are a convicted sex offender. You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date. You will not share your password (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account. You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission. If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).   Protecting Other People's Rights  We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same. You will not post content or take any action on Facebook that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law. We can remove any content or information you post on Facebook if we believe that it violates this Statement or our policies. We provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more, visit our How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement page. If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal. If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate. You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including Facebook, the Facebook and F Logos, FB, Face, Poke, Book and Wall), or any confusingly similar marks, except as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission. If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not Facebook) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it. You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on Facebook. You will not tag users or send email invitations to non-users without their consent. Facebook offers social reporting tools to enable users to provide feedback about tagging.   Mobile and Other Devices  We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, will still apply. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you will update your account information on Facebook within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number. You provide consent and all rights necessary to enable users to sync (including through an application) their devices with any information that is visible to them on Facebook.   Payments  If you make a payment on Facebook or use Facebook Credits, you agree to our Payments Terms.   Special Provisions Applicable to Social Plugins   If you include our Social Plugins, such as the Share or Like buttons on your website, the following additional terms apply to you: We give you permission to use Facebook's Social Plugins so that users can post links or content from your website on Facebook. You give us permission to use and allow others to use such links and content on Facebook. You will not place a Social Plugin on any page containing content that would violate this Statement if posted on Facebook.   Special Provisions Applicable to Developers/Operators of Applications and Websites   If you are a developer or operator of a Platform application or website, the following additional terms apply to you: You are responsible for your application and its content and all uses you make of Platform. This includes ensuring your application or use of Platform meets our Facebook Platform Policies and our Advertising Guidelines. Your access to and use of data you receive from Facebook, will be limited as follows: You will only request data you need to operate your application.

You will delete all data you receive from us concerning a user if the user asks you to do so, and will provide a mechanism for users to make such a request. You will not include data you receive from us concerning a user in any advertising creative. You will not directly or indirectly transfer any data you receive from us to (or use such data in connection with) any ad network, ad exchange, data broker, or other advertising related toolset, even if a user consents to that transfer or use. You will not sell user data.  If you are acquired by or merge with a third party, you can continue to use user data within your application, but you cannot transfer user data outside of your application.  We can require you to delete user data if you use it in a way that we determine is inconsistent with users’ expectations. We can limit your access to data.

In instances where we believe doing so will enhance the effectiveness of your advertising campaign, we may broaden the targeting criteria you specify. You will pay for your Orders in accordance with our Payments Terms. The amount you owe will be calculated based on our tracking mechanisms. Your ads will comply with our Advertising Guidelines. We will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your ads. We do not guarantee the activity that your ads will receive, such as the number of clicks your ads will get.

  <h1>Edgar Allan Poe, “The Tell-Tale Heart”</h1>
  <p>2,125 words</p>
  <p class="tiny">THE TELL-TALE HEART.    True! nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses, not destroyed, not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How then am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily, how calmly I can tell you the whole story.  It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain, but, once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! Yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture—a pale blue eye with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold, and so by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded; with what caution, with what foresight, with what dissimulation, I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night about midnight I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh, so gently! And then when I had made an opening sufficient for my head I put in a dark lantern all closed, closed so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly, very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this? And then when my head was well in the room I undid the lantern cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges creaked), I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights, every night just at midnight, but I found the eye always closed, and so it was impossible to do the work, for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers, of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was opening the door little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea, and perhaps he heard me, for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back—but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.  I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying out, "Who's there?"  I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed, listening; just as I have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall.  Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no! it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself, "It is nothing but the wind in the chimney, it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; but he had found all in vain. All in vain, because Death in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel, although he neither saw nor heard, to feel the presence of my head within the room.  When I had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little— a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily—until at length a single dim ray like the thread of the spider shot out from the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye.  It was open, wide, wide open, and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones, but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person, for I had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot.  And now have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses? now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder, every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.  I took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no bloodspot whatever. I had been too wary for that.  When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart—for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.  I smiled—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears; but still they sat, and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct;—it continued and became more distinct. I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling, but it continued and gained definitiveness—until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.  No doubt I now grew very pale; but I talked more fluently and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise steadily increased. O God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no, no! They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of my horror!—this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!—and now—again!—hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!  "Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear up the planks!—here, here!—it is the beating of his hideous heart!"</p>
