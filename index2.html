  <h1>American Airlines Conditions of Carriage</h1>
  <p>CONDITIONS OF CARRIAGE Your ticket and the following Conditions of Carriage constitute the contract between you, the passenger, and American Airlines, Inc. ("American") and apply to all transportation provided by American (including transportation on codeshare partners*) between points in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with the Department of Transportation. See International General Rules Tariff. On some international itineraries, taxes and fees are added to the price of the ticket. Every price offered by American is the full price, which consists of the base fare, applicable carrier-imposed fees (such as surcharges), and government-imposed taxes and fees. On average, for the year ended March 31, 2012, our passengers paid $349.70 in taxes and fees (where applicable) as part of their ticket price.  American will act as an agent to issue tickets, check baggage and book reservations for transportation via other carriers which have interline agreements with American. Other carriers may have different terms and conditions applicable to their flights. These may be obtained directly from the other carriers.  Please read your contract carefully.

When reduced fares are for sale for a limited period of time, American reserves the right to decline to issue refunds. For non-refundable fares, the passenger will receive the difference in the fares in the form of a non-refundable American travel voucher valid only for purchase of air transportation on American, and must be used within one (1) year of issuance.  *Note - the purchase of a Prepaid Ticket will constitute purchase of a ticket.  If American increases the price for the transportation, an additional collection may be made for:  Any segments where you change your flight to a different time, date or routing from that shown on your ticket, and Any segment shown as "open" on your ticket. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCHEDULES AND OPERATIONS American will endeavor to carry you and your baggage with reasonable dispatch, but times shown in timetables or elsewhere are not guaranteed and form no part of this contract. American may, without notice, substitute alternate carriers or aircraft and, if necessary, may alter or omit stopping places shown on the ticket. Schedules are subject to change without notice. American is not responsible for or liable for failure to make connections, or to operate any flight according to schedule, or for a change to the schedule of any flight. Under no circumstances shall American be liable for any special, incidental or consequential damages arising from the foregoing.  Return to Top  FORCE MAJEURE EVENTS American may, in the event of a force majeure event, without notice, cancel, terminate, divert, postpone or delay any flight or the right of carriage or reservation of traffic accommodations without liability except to issue an involuntary refund. The involuntary refund will be made in the original form of payment in accordance with involuntary refund rules for any unused portion of the ticket. American will also reserve the right to determine if any departure or landing should be made without any liability except the afore mentioned involuntary refund.  Force Majeure Event Means:  Any condition beyond American's control including, but without limitation, meteorological conditions, acts of God, riots, civil commotion, embargoes, wars, hostilities, disturbances or unsettled international conditions - actual threatened or reported.

Return to Top  OVERSALES If a flight is oversold (more passengers hold confirmed reservations than there are seats available), no one may be denied boarding against his or her will until airline personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservation willingly, in exchange for compensation of the airline’s choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, other passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily in accordance with the following boarding priority of American. In such events, American will usually deny boarding based upon check-in time, but we may also consider factors such as severe hardships, fare paid, and status within the AAdvantage® program.  If you are denied boarding involuntarily, you are entitled to a payment of ‘‘denied boarding compensation’’ from the airline unless:  You have not fully complied with the airline’s ticketing, check-in and reconfirmation requirements, or you are not acceptable for transportation under the airline’s usual rules and practices; or You are denied boarding because the flight is canceled; or You are denied boarding because a smaller capacity aircraft was substituted for safety or operational reasons; or On a flight operated with an aircraft having 60 or fewer seats, you are denied boarding due to safety-related weight/balance restrictions that limit payload; or You are offered accommodations in a section of the aircraft other than specified in your ticket, at no extra charge (a passenger seated in a section for which a lower fare is charged must be given an appropriate refund); or The airline is able to place you on another flight or flights that are planned to reach your next stopover or final destination within one hour of the planned arrival time of your original flight. Domestic Transportation Passengers traveling between points within the United States (including the territories and possessions) who are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight are entitled to:  No compensation if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger’s destination or first stopover not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger’s original flight; 200% of the fare to the passenger’s destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $650, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger’s destination or first stopover more than one hour but less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger’s original flight; and 400% of the fare to the passenger’s destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $1,300, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger’s destination or first stopover less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger’s original flight. 0 to 1 hour arrival delay - No compensation. 1 to 2 hour arrival delay - 200% of one-way fare (but no more than $650). Over 2 hours arrival delay - 400% of one-way fare (but no more than $1,300). International Transportation Passengers traveling from the United States to a foreign point who are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight originating at a U.S. airport are entitled to:  No compensation if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger’s destination or first stopover not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger’s original flight; 200% of the fare to the passenger’s destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $650, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger’s destination or first stopover more than one hour but less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger’s original flight; and 400% of the fare to the passenger’s destination or first stopover, with a maximum of $1,300, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger’s destination or first stopover less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger’s original flight. 0 to 1 hour arrival delay - No compensation. 1 to 4 hour arrival delay - 200% of one-way fare (but no more than $650). Over 4 hours arrival delay - 400% of one-way fare (but no more than $1,300). Return to Top  BAGGAGE General Acceptance of Baggage Only baggage as defined in the definition section will be accepted for transportation. All baggage is subject to inspection. Checked baggage will be accepted for transportation only on flights on which you are traveling. American will not accept baggage whose size, weight, or character makes it unsuitable for transportation on the aircraft as determined by American.  No article will be accepted as baggage if it weighs more than 100 pounds or has a total outside dimension (length plus width plus height) of more than 126 inches. Additional restrictions apply to some American flights operated on smaller aircraft. For further information, contact American Airlines.  Checking Your Bag Your name must appear on all baggage.

Baggage will not be released unless all sums due American are paid. Baggage claim checks must be returned to American on request. American is not responsible to determine that the holder of the claim check is entitled to the baggage. If baggage claim checks are lost, proof of ownership may be required prior to release of the baggage.  In the event your checked bags do not arrive on your flight, reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that the bag is returned to you within 24 hours for flights within the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our goal to return bags within 24 hours applies only when we are the carrier taking you to your final destination.  Listed below are some circumstances that may inhibit our ability to return your bags within 24 hours:  No local name/address/phone numbers are provided You are located at a remote location or an /unreachable/ address, such as a cruise ship or a camping site You changed your delivery address, but did not notify us We have limited flight schedules to your destination Operational circumstances prevent American airlines or American Eagle from being able to locate or deliver your bags within this time frame. Carry-on Baggage The suitability of carry-on baggage will be determined by American. Each customer will be limited to one carry-on bag and one personal item. A personal item includes a purse, briefcase, laptop, or small book bag style backpack. A personal item must fit under the seat. Fragile or valuable items, such as keys, medication or computers should be carried in your personal item.  At times, additional limits may be placed on carry-on baggage based on the main cabin stowage capacity of specific aircraft, which can result in carry-on bags being checked in the boarding area. In the event it is necessary to check carry-on bags, ensure that fragile or valuable items, such as keys, medication or computers are carried in your personal item. If government regulations are more restrictive, such restrictions shall apply.  A carry-on bag must fit in the bag sizer and not exceed overall dimensions of 45 inches (length + width + height). The maximum combined linear measurement of the carry-on bag cannot exceed any of the following measurements: 22" long x 14" wide x 9" tall or 114cm (56 x 35 x 23 cm). All carry-on items must fit under the seat or in an overhead bin.  Note: A garment bag (which fits in the bag sizer) will count as the passenger's carry-on bag.  On American Eagle flights each customer is limited to a personal item in the cabin, but their carry-on item (not exceeding 45 dimensional inches) will be valet checked at the gate or planeside.  Carry-on items which appear too large or irregularly shaped to fit under a seat, in an overhead compartment, or in a closet or luggage rack will not be accepted for passenger cabin stowage.  Any mobility aid or assistive device that is approved for in-cabin transport on American, and is carried by a qualified disabled passenger, is accepted free of charge and is in addition to normal baggage allowances, provided such aid or device fits in an approved stowage space.  All baggage must be completely stowed before the airplane may depart the gate.  Checked Baggage Checked baggage charges apply to the first and second checked bag. Some exceptions apply. Excess bag charges apply for more than two checked bags. Oversize and overweight charges apply to baggage over the free size and weight allowance. Specialty items may have additional charges or exceptions to baggage charges.  Hazardous Items Hazardous materials will not be accepted as baggage except for limited amounts of dry ice subject to Americans rules. See Restricted Items.  Firearms Firearms and ammunition will be accepted only as checked baggage, subject to American's rules. See Transporting Firearms and Ammunition.  Live Animals Pets (cats and dogs only) will be accepted as baggage when confined in a container, subject to American's rules and charges. Service animals to detect explosives and drugs and dogs for search and rescue will be accepted in the passenger cabin subject to American's rules and charges. See Pets. Live animals will not be accepted for interline transfer to other airline flights. Certain restrictions apply for some American Eagle flights. For more information, contact American Airlines reservations.   Liability American's liability for loss, damage or delayed delivery of checked baggage, including transfer baggage, is limited to the actual value of the baggage or $3,300 (the amount will increase to $3,400 for travel beginning on June 6, 2013 ), whichever is less, unless the passenger declares a higher value for loss of baggage, not to exceed $5000.00 including the $3,300 (the amount will increase to $3,400 for travel beginning on June 6, 2013 ) standard liability per passenger and pays American a sum of $2.00 per $100.00 (or any portion thereof) of excess value. Excess valuation coverage is not available for and does not apply to items excluded in our liability below. See Additional Insurance.  American does not assume liability for any of the following items in or as checked baggage: antiques, artifacts, artwork, books and documents, china, computers and other electronic equipment, computer software, fragile items (including child/infant restraint devices such as strollers and car seats), eyeglasses, prescription sunglasses, non-prescription sunglasses and all other eyewear and eye/vision devices whether lenses are glass, plastic, or some other material, furs, heirlooms, keys, liquids, medicines, money, orthotics, surgical supports, perishable items, photographic, video and optical equipment, precious metals, stones or jewelry, securities and negotiable papers, silverware, samples, unique or irreplaceable items or any other similar valuable items.  With the exception of strollers, American does not accept these items in or as checked baggage and assumes no responsibility or liability for such items, regardless of whether American knew or should have known of the presence of such items in checked or transferred baggage. If any such items are lost, damaged or delayed, you will not be entitled to any reimbursement under American's standard baggage liability, or under any declared excess valuation. Do not attempt to check these items. Carry them with you in the passenger cabin (subject to carry-on baggage limitations). Fully collapsible strollers may be carried on board with the passenger as long as they fit in an overhead bin. Strollers exceeding a maximum weight of 20lbs or that are not capable of being transported inside the cabin due to size must be checked at a ticket counter. American will not assume liability for strollers that are not checked in original and/or suitable packaging for safe transport.  American assumes no responsibility for loss, damage or delayed delivery of baggage not acceptable for transportation by American as checked baggage and items damaged as a result of items contained in checked or transferred baggage.  Customers with disabilities traveling with wheelchairs or other mobility devices are exempt from liability restrictions for loss, damage or delays to these items.  American assumes no liability for articles carried in the passenger cabin.  American assumes no liability for minor damage such as scratches, scuffs, stains, dents, cuts and dirt resulting from normal wear and tear.

American assumes no liability for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive or special damages resulting from loss, damage or delayed delivery of checked or transferred baggage, including, without limitation, damages for lost revenue or profits, loss of use or business interruption.  We may disallow any claim for loss or damage which contains misrepresentations, including false statements concerning whether or not the passenger has made previous claims with American or other carriers and/or where the passenger fails to have the carrier's baggage claim declaration form notarized. AA may also disallow claims when the passenger fails to provide proof of loss in the form of receipts of purchase.  Legal Action Legal action premised on or related to damage, delay or loss must be commenced within two years of the date of the incident.  Missing Items Items missing from checked baggage must be reported to American before leaving the airport or within 24 hours of the receipt of the bag.  Loss/Delay In the case of delay or loss, an initial complaint must be presented to American prior to leaving the arrival airport for which the baggage was checked or should have been checked. At the latest, such initial report must be made within four hours of the arrival of the flight on which the passenger traveled. For passengers purchasing the American Airlines baggage delivery service provided through BAGS VIP Luggage Delivery in advance of travel, the initial report must be made within 12 hours of the arrival of the flight on which the passenger traveled.  If compensation is sought for a delay or loss, a written claim, in the form provided by American, must be received by American no later than thirty days after the initial report was presented and recorded by American.  Damaged Baggage No action shall lie in the case of damage to baggage unless the person entitled to delivery files an initial report with American prior to leaving the arrival airport, or at the latest, within 24 hours from the date of receipt of the baggage.  After the initial report of damage to American, the damaged property must be presented to American for repair within thirty days from the date of the initial report of damage to American.  Claims Failure to report delayed or damaged baggage or missing contents within the prescribed time limit releases American from liability.

Return to Top  REFUNDS General Refunds Some tickets are non-refundable. If you have a refundable ticket, American will issue a refund as follows.  If the ticket is totally unused, the full amount paid will be refunded.  If the ticket is partially used, the refund will be the difference between the fare paid and the fare for the transportation actually used as determined by the applicable rules.  In addition, if the ticket to be refunded is no longer valid for transportation, an administrative service charge will be assessed upon refund of the ticket. This service charge will be collected by deducting the applicable service charge from the amount which otherwise would be refunded. Tickets will be refunded only to the person named on the ticket as passenger, except that:  Tickets purchased with a credit card will be refunded only as a credit to the credit card account, Tickets issued against a prepaid ticket advice will be refunded only to the purchaser, and Tickets issued against a government transportation request will be refunded only to the government agency which issued the transportation request. Once travel has commenced, refund requests for lower fares will not be honored.  American will strive to process eligible refunds in the time frames set out below, upon receipt of all required information.  For all eligible paper and electronic tickets purchased within the U.S. with a credit card or cash, refunds will be provided within 7 business days of receipt of the required refund information. The credit card refund may take up to two billing cycles before appearing on a credit card statement, so you should contact your credit card company directly to verify receipt of the credit. Tickets purchased with a check will be refunded within 20 days of receipt of the required information.  Refunds for electronic tickets may be obtained through the refund section on our website at AA.com or by contacting American Airlines reservations.  Refunds on tickets, paper or electronic, less than $3,000 can be obtained at any of our U.S. airport ticket offices or City Ticket Offices. All other refund requests should be sent to the following address: American Airlines, Inc. Passenger Refund Services P.O. Box 200025 El Paso, Texas 88520-0025 Certain refund requests cannot be accommodated in the time frames discussed above. For example, refunds for lost tickets must be held for 90 days to ensure that they are not found and used. Tickets with adjustments (for example, a customer buys a first class ticket but actually travels in the main or coach cabin) require that we verify the itinerary and class of service flown, and this can take up to 45 days. Tickets that were purchased outside the U.S. require special handling because we must ensure that currency conversion rates are calculated correctly.  Refund for credit card purchases will be made only to the credit card account.  Service charges are collected for some refunds e.g., lost tickets.  American assumes no liability for any special, incidental, or consequential damages for instances in which we do not meet our goals for processing refunds.  Helpful Suggestions To ensure a prompt refund, you must submit all required documentation and information including,  Valid ticket submitted to us before expiration date - tickets expire one year from the date of issue Original unused flight coupons for paper tickets Ticket number for electronic tickets Brief written explanation Your name, address, and telephone number(s), email address, form of payment used to purchase the ticket Involuntary Refunds In the event the refund is required because of American's failure to operate on schedule or refusal to transport, the following refund will be made directly to you -  If the ticket is totally unused, the full amount paid (with no service charge or refund penalty), or If the ticket is partially used, the applicable fare for the unused segment(s). American shall not be obligated to refund any portion(s) of a ticket which does not reflect a confirmed reservation on an American flight involved in a schedule irregularity, unless such ticket was issued by American.

CUSTOMERS WITH DISABILITIES American endeavors to provide passengers with disabilities dignified, professional, and courteous service at all times. We have a team of employees who regularly consult with disability advisory groups on the quality of our service.  Reservations Special Assistance Coordinators American reservations offices maintain a staff of Special Assistance Coordinators (SAC) who work with customers who have identified themselves as having disabilities. The reservations representative who responds to the customer's initial call passes pertinent information to a SAC who calls the customer back. A toll-free number exists for customers with disabilities to follow-up on travel arrangements with the SAC office. Airport and in-flight personnel are notified of special service requests.  Pre-Reserved Seats American blocks a limited number of seats on each aircraft to accommodate customers who identify themselves as having a qualified disability. Adjacent seats are provided, under certain circumstances, for customers with disabilities who must travel with a companion for assistance.  Assistive Devices American accepts motorized and non-motorized assistive devices for transport. When necessary, we will disassemble and reassemble wheelchairs or assistive devices for customers when they travel. American provides storage for one passenger's collapsible, manual wheelchair in the cabin of each jet aircraft. This service is available on a first-come, first served basis, and has priority over carry-on baggage belonging to other customers who board at the same city, provided the customer follows the pre-boarding procedure. In-cabin stowage space for assistive devices cannot be pre-reserved, but American accepts carry-on wheelchairs, provided they collapse to fit in an overhead bin or under a seat. Non-collapsible wheelchairs/scooters are accepted as checked baggage. These items can be checked at the main ticket counter or the departure gate. American offers a special wheelchair service that allows you to check your wheelchair at the departure gate and claim it at your arrival gate free of charge. Although you can arrange to claim your chair at the connecting city we recommend that the chair be checked through to the final destination. The additional time required to claim and re-check your chair at the connecting city may compromise your ability to make your connection. American has wheelchairs and our representatives provide wheelchair service at connecting airports. Please let us know you will need this assistance when making your reservation. Assistive devices approved for cabin transport do not count towards the combined number of checked and carry-on baggage a passenger is allowed, nor do they count towards the limit of carry-on items you may bring on board.  Boarding Assistance If you have special needs, upon request, pre-boarding assistance will be provided to you, allowing you the opportunity to be seated prior to general boarding. A special aisle chair is available to assist you if you are unable to walk, and all of our jet aircraft are equipped with specially designed seats that feature moveable aisle armrests to help make seating easier.  Medical Oxygen Only portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) approved by the FAA are accepted for inflight medical oxygen. A 48-hour notice is required. Contact American Airlines at 1-800-433-7300 to obtain information regarding the required medical paperwork.

  <h1>Charlotte Perkins Gilman - The Yellow Wall Paper</h1>
  <p>The Yellow Wall Paper THE YELLOW WALL PAPER   THE  YELLOW WALL PAPER  BY CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON    The Yellow Wall Paper pg 7.jpg  BOSTON SMALL, MAYNARD & COMPANY MCMI   Copyright, 1892 By New England Magazine Corporation  Copyright, 1899 By Small, Maynard & Company    Rockwell & Churchill Press Boston, U.S.A.     This story is reprinted from The New England Magazine of January, 1892, by permission of the publisher, to whom the thanks of the Author are due. The cover design is by Mr. E. B. Bird.   THE YELLOW WALL PAPER    IT is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer.  A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity, — but that would be asking too much of fate!  Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.  Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?  John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.  John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.  John is a physician, and perhaps — (I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind) — perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.  You see, he does not believe I am sick!  And what can one do?  If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression, — a slight hysterical tendency, — what is one to do?  My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same thing.  So I take phosphates or phosphites, — whichever it is, — and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to "work" until I am well again.  Personally I disagree with their ideas.  Personally I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good.  But what is one to do?  I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good deal — having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.  I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus — but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.  So I will let it alone and talk about the house.  The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.  There is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden — large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them.  There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.  There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.  That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don't care — there is something strange about the house — I can feel it.  I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was a draught, and shut the window.  I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.  But John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself, — before him, at least,—and that makes me very tired.  I don't like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty, old-fashioned chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.  He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him if he took another.  He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction.  I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.  He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. "Your exercise depends on your strength, my dear," said he, "and your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time." So we took the nursery, at the top of the house.  It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then playground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.  The paint and paper look as if a boys' school had used it. It is stripped off — the paper — in great patches all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.  One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin.  It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame, uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide — plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard-of contradictions.  The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.  It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others.  No wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long.  There comes John, and I must put this away, — he hates to have me write a word.    We have been here two weeks, and I haven't felt like writing before, since that first day. I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.  John is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.  I am glad my case is not serious!  But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.  John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no reason to suffer, and that satisfies him.  Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way!  I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already!  Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able — to dress and entertain, and order things.  It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!  And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.  I suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this wall paper!  At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.  He said that after the wall paper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of the stairs, and so on.  "You know the place is doing you good," he said, "and really, dear, I don't care to renovate the house just for a three months' rental."  "Then do let us go downstairs," I said, "there are such pretty rooms there."  Then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into the bargain.  But he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.  It is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of course, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.  I'm really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper.  Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.  Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.  I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.  But I find I get pretty tired when I try.  It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.  I wish I could get well faster.  But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had!  There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.  I got positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths didn't match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other.  I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy-store.  I remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.  I used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could always hop into that chair and be safe.  The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for we had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I never saw such ravages as the children have made here.  The wall paper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother — they must have had perseverance as well as hatred.  Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is all we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.  But I don't mind it a bit — only the paper.  There comes John's sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of me! I must not let her find me writing.  She is a perfect, an enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better profession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me sick!  But I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these windows.  There is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road, and one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of great elms and velvet meadows.  This wall paper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.  But in the places where it isn't faded, and where the sun is just so, I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.  There's sister on the stairs!    Well, the Fourth of July is over! The people are all gone and I am tired out. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week. Of course I didn't do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.  But it tired me all the same.  John says if I don't pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall.  But I don't want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!  Besides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.  I don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything, and I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.  I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.  Of course I don't when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am alone.  And I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.  So I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.  I'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall paper. Perhaps because of the wall paper.  It dwells in my mind so!  I lie here on this great immovable bed — it is nailed down, I believe — and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I assure you. I start, we'll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion.  I know a little of the principles of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.  It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.  Looked at in one way, each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and flourishes — a kind of "debased Romanesque" with delirium tremens — go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.  But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase.  The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction.  They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion.  There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when the cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can almost fancy radiation, after all, — the interminable grotesques seem to form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal distraction.  It makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap, I guess.    I don't know why I should write this. I don't want to.  I don't feel able.  And I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and think in some way — it is such a relief!  But the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.  Half the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.  John says I mustn't lose my strength, and has me take cod-liver oil and lots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.  Dear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell him how I wished he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and Julia.  But he said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished.  It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this nervous weakness, I suppose.  And dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till he tired my head.  He said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.  He says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and self-control and not let my silly fancies run away with me.  There's one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to occupy this nursery with the horrid wall paper.  If we had not used it that blessed child would have! What a fortunate escape! Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, live in such a room for worlds.  I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here, after all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.  Of course I never mention it to them any more, — I am too wise, — but I keep watch of it all the same.  There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.  Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.  It is always the same shape, only very numerous.  And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. I don't like it a bit. I wonder — I begin to think — I wish John would take me away from here!    It is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise, and because he loves me so. But I tried it last night.  It was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.  I hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by one window or another.  John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wall paper till I felt creepy.  The faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she wanted to get out.  I got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and when I came back John was awake.  "What is it, little girl?" he said. "Don't go walking about like that — you'll get cold."  I thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was not gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.  "Why, darling!" said he, "our lease will be up in three weeks, and I can't see how to leave before.  "The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but you really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is better. I feel really much easier about you."  "I don't weigh a bit more," said I, "nor as much; and my appetite may be better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the morning, when you are away."  "Bless her little heart!" said he with a big hug; "she shall be as sick as she pleases. But now let's improve the shining hours by going to sleep, and talk about it in the morning."  "And you won't go away?" I asked gloomily.  "Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house ready. Really, dear, you are better!"  "Better in body, perhaps" — I began, and stopped short, for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I could not say another word.  "My darling," said he, "I beg of you, for my sake and for our child's sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?"  So of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before long. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn't, — I lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern really did move together or separately.    On a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind. The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing.  You think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in following, it turns a back somersault, and there you are. It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad dream.  The outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus. If you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions, — why, that is something like it.  That is, sometimes!  There is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.  When the sun shoots in through the east window — I always watch for that first long, straight ray — it changes so quickly that I never can quite believe it.  That is why I watch it always.  By moonlight — the moon shines in all night when there is a moon — I wouldn't know it was the same paper.  At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and worst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern, I mean, and the woman behind it is as plain as can be.  I didn't realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind, — that dim sub-pattern, — but now I am quite sure it is a woman.  By daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps her so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.  I lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep all I can.  Indeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each meal.  It is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don't sleep.  And that cultivates deceit, for I don't tell them I'm awake, — oh, no!  The fact is, I am getting a little afraid of John.  He seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.  It strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that perhaps it is the paper!  I have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I've caught him several times looking at the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with her hand on it once.  She didn't know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a very quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing, and looked quite angry — asked me why I should frighten her so!  Then she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John's, and she wished we would be more careful!  Did not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern, and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!    Life is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat better, and am more quiet than I was. John is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall paper.  I turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was because of the wall paper — he would make fun of me. He might even want to take me away.  I don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week more, and I think that will be enough.  I'm feeling ever so much better! I don't sleep much at night, for it is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.  In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.  There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously.  It is the strangest yellow, that wall paper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw — not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.  But there is something else about that paper — the smell! I noticed it the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was not bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows are open or not the smell is here.  It creeps all over the house.  I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.  It gets into my hair.  Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it — there is that smell!  Such a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it, to find what it smelled like.  It is not bad — at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I ever met.  In this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me.  It used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the house — to reach the smell.  But now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like is the color of the paper — a yellow smell!  There is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A streak that runs around the room. It goes behind every piece of furniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had been rubbed over and over.  I wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round and round and round — round and round and round — it makes me dizzy!    I really have discovered something at last. Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.  The front pattern does move — and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!  Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.  Then in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.  And she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb through that pattern — it strangles so; I think that is why it has so many heads.  They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside-down, and makes their eyes white!  If those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.    I think that woman gets out in the daytime! And I'll tell you why — privately — I've seen her!  I can see her out of every one of my windows!  It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women do not creep by daylight.  I see her in that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in those dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.  I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.  I don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight!  I always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can't do it at night, for I know John would suspect something at once.  And John is so queer, now, that I don't want to irritate him. I wish he would take another room! Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself.  I often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.  But, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.  And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can turn!  I have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.    If only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean to try it, little by little. I have found out another funny thing, but I shan't tell it this time! It does not do to trust people too much.  There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John is beginning to notice. I don't like the look in his eyes.  And I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She had a very good report to give.  She said I slept a good deal in the daytime.  John knows I don't sleep very well at night, for all I'm so quiet!  He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving and kind.  As if I couldn't see through him!  Still, I don't wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three months.  It only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly affected by it.    Hurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town over night, and won't be out until this evening. Jennie wanted to sleep with me — the sly thing! but I told her I should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.  That was clever, for really I wasn't alone a bit! As soon as it was moonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I got up and ran to help her.  I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper.  A strip about as high as my head and half around the room.  And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me I declared I would finish it today!  We go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to leave things as they were before.  Jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.  She laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself, but I must not get tired.  How she betrayed herself that time!  But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me — not alive!  She tried to get me out of the room — it was too patent! But I said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner — I would call when I woke.  So now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone, and there is nothing left but that great bed-stead nailed down, with the canvas mattress we found on it.  We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.  I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.  How those children did tear about here!  This bedstead is fairly gnawed!  But I must get to work.  I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.  I don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, till John comes.  I want to astonish him.  I've got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!  But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!  This bed will not move!  I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I bit off a little piece at one corner — but it hurt my teeth.  Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision!  I am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to try.  Besides, I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued.  I don't like to look out of the windows even — there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast.  I wonder if they all come out of that wall paper, as I did?  But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope — you don't get me out in the road there!  I suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night, and that is hard!  It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please!  I don't want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennie asks me to.  For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow.  But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.  Why, there's John at the door!  It is no use, young man, you can't open it!  How he does call and pound!  Now he's crying for an axe.  It would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!  "John, dear!" said I in the gentlest voice, "the key is down by the front steps, under a plantain leaf!"  That silenced him for a few moments.  Then he said — very quietly indeed, "Open the door, my darling!"  "I can't," said I. "The key is down by the front door, under a plantain leaf!"  And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course, and came in. He stopped short by the door.  "What is the matter?" he cried. "For God's sake, what are you doing?"  I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.  "I've got out at last," said I, "in spite of you and Jane! And I've pulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!"  Now why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my path by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!</p>

  <h1>Edgar Allan Poe - The Tell-Tale Heart</h1>
  <p>THE TELL-TALE HEART.    True! nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses, not destroyed, not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How then am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily, how calmly I can tell you the whole story.  It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain, but, once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! Yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture—a pale blue eye with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold, and so by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded; with what caution, with what foresight, with what dissimulation, I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night about midnight I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh, so gently! And then when I had made an opening sufficient for my head I put in a dark lantern all closed, closed so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly, very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this? And then when my head was well in the room I undid the lantern cautiously—oh, so cautiously—cautiously (for the hinges creaked), I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights, every night just at midnight, but I found the eye always closed, and so it was impossible to do the work, for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers, of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was opening the door little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea, and perhaps he heard me, for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back—but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.  I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying out, "Who's there?"  I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed, listening; just as I have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall.  Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief—oh, no! it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself, "It is nothing but the wind in the chimney, it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; but he had found all in vain. All in vain, because Death in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel, although he neither saw nor heard, to feel the presence of my head within the room.  When I had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little— a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it—you cannot imagine how stealthily—until at length a single dim ray like the thread of the spider shot out from the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye.  It was open, wide, wide open, and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness—all a dull blue with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones, but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person, for I had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot.  And now have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses? now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder, every instant. The old man's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment!—do you mark me well? I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me—the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once—once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.  I took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye—not even his—could have detected anything wrong. There was nothing to wash out—no stain of any kind—no bloodspot whatever. I had been too wary for that.  When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock—still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart—for what had I now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.  I smiled—for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search—search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim.  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears; but still they sat, and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct;—it continued and became more distinct. I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling, but it continued and gained definitiveness—until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.  No doubt I now grew very pale; but I talked more fluently and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased—and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath—and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly—more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men—but the noise steadily increased. O God! what could I do? I foamed—I raved—I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder—louder—louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!—no, no! They heard!—they suspected!—they knew!—they were making a mockery of my horror!—this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!—and now—again!—hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!  "Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I admit the deed!—tear up the planks!—here, here!—it is the beating of his hideous heart!"</p>

If we accept your Order, we will deliver your ads as inventory becomes available. When serving your ad, we do our best to deliver the ads to the audience you specify, although we cannot guarantee in every instance that your ad will reach its intended target. In instances where we believe doing so will enhance the effectiveness of your advertising campaign, we may broaden the targeting criteria you specify. You will pay for your Orders in accordance with our Payments Terms. The amount you owe will be calculated based on our tracking mechanisms. Your ads will comply with our Advertising Guidelines. We will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your ads. We do not guarantee the activity that your ads will receive, such as the number of clicks your ads will get.

  <h1>Google Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Google Terms of Service  Last modified: April 14, 2014 (view archived versions)  Welcome to Google!  Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by Google Inc. (“Google”), located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.  By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.  Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.  Using our Services  You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.  Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.  Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.  Our Services display some content that is not Google’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.  In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.  Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.  Your Google Account  You may need a Google Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Google Account, or your Google Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Google Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.  To protect your Google Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Google Account. Try not to reuse your Google Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google Account, follow these instructions.  Privacy and Copyright Protection  Google’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Google can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.  We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Google’s policy about responding to notices in our Help Center.  Your Content in our Services  Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.  When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.  Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.  If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Google Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.  You can find more information about how Google uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.  About Software in our Services  When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.  Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.  Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.  Modifying and Terminating our Services  We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.  You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.  We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.  Our Warranties and Disclaimers  We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.  OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.  SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.  Liability for our Services  WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, GOOGLE, AND GOOGLE’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF GOOGLE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).  IN ALL CASES, GOOGLE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.  Business uses of our Services  If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.  About these Terms  We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.  If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.  These terms control the relationship between Google and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.  If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).  If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.  The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
